<h1>Geometry Shaders</h1>
<p><a id="INDEX857"></a> Geometry shaders do not
really shade anything, they create scene elements, primarily
geometric objects. For this purpose, they use a special geometry
shader API that is analogous to the statements of the .mi scene
definition language. This chapter describes this API, and how
geometry shaders use it.</p>
<p>Geometry shaders can be used in two places: in
<a href="node90.html#INDEX339">instance</a> definitions that reference a
shader instead of an object, light, camera, or instance group:</p>
<pre>
    instance "<i>name</i>"  
        geometry <i>function</i>  
        ...  
    end instance  
</pre>
<p><a id="INDEX858"></a><a id="INDEX859"></a> or in phenomena,
where they can be attached to the geometry root:</p>
<pre>
    declare phenomenon  
        ...  
        geometry <i>function</i>  
        ...  
    end declare  
</pre>
<p>In either case, the geometry shader is evaluated during scene
preprocessing before any other operation such as rendering starts.
The geometry shader is expected to create an object, light, camera,
or instance group and add the tag of the created element to the
result. The <i>result</i> pointer passed as its first argument
always has the type <tt>miTag *</tt>, and the shader must be
declared as</p>
<pre>
    declare shader  
        geometry "<i>shader_name</i>" ("<i>parameter_decl</i>")  
        ...  
    end declare  
</pre>
<p>If <i>result</i> is a null tag, the created element can be
returned directly using this pointer, otherwise the geometry shader
must check whether the type of the item to which <i>result</i>
refers is <tt>miSCENE_GROUP</tt>. If it refers to an instance
group, the created entities can be put into this group, otherwise
the shader must create the group and put the element to which
<i>result</i> refers together with the entities created by the
geometry shader into the instance group. The newly created instance
group must be returned in <i>result</i> in this case. This ensures
that geometry shaders always return either an object or an instance
group, and that they can be chained such that the end result is a
group. There is a <a href="node138.html#INDEX510">shader interface
function</a> available for adding scene entities to <i>result</i>
which takes all the above rules into account; refer to
<b><a id="INDEX860"></a>mi_geoshader_add_result</b>.</p>
<p>Creation of geometry requires an altogether different set of
shader interface functions. The shader is basically doing the same
thing that an object or other definition expressed in the .mi
language is doing, and must have the same functionality available
to it. In fact, the <a href="node138.html#INDEX510">shader
interface function</a>s for geometry shaders closely model the .mi
language features: there are <i>begin</i>/ <i>end</i> functions for
most top-level entities and complex sub-entities, and various
helper functions to create and attach complex information. Many of
these return pointers to the created data structures that let the
geometry shader store primitive data directly without the use of a
<a href="node138.html#INDEX510">shader interface function</a>.</p>
<p>Geometry shaders must include <tt>geoshader.h</tt> after
<tt>shader.h</tt>.</p>
<p>This chapter provides an example and lists all shader interface
API functions and data structure declarations available to geometry
shaders. It does not explain the structure and order of specific
API calls needed to create a scene. Refer to chapter
<a href="node60.html#scenechapter">scenechapter</a> for the sequence of
operations necessary to create a scene element, and to appendix A
for the correspondence between API calls and the entities in the
scene description language they create.</p>
<p>In any case, writing geometry shaders is far more complex than
writing another type of shader. Although a geometry shader has free
run of the entire scene database, and is free to copy-and-alter or
create any part of it, it is generally a good idea to avoid doing
too much with them. Instead, it is usually preferable to pass
objects, materials, and shaders as input parameters instead of
creating entire graphs in geometry shaders, although this is
possible and sometimes needed in geometry shaders used in
phenomena. Geometry shaders must never modify existing parts of the
scene because this will confuse future incremental changes and
scene traversal during preprocessing, which geometry shaders are
part of. Instead, the element to be modified should be passed to
the geometry shader as a parameter of type <tt>geometry</tt>, and
be used as a template to create a new, modified element.</p>
<p>All geometry shader API calls and data structures may
<i>only</i> be used in geometry shaders, not any other type of
shader. Conversely, no regular <a href="node138.html#INDEX510">shader interface function</a> related to
rendering may be used in a geometry shader because it is called
before rendering begins. Geometry shaders are called during the
same stage as displacement shaders, but before the displacement
shaders of objects created by this geometry shader.</p>
<p>mental ray 3.0 allows a geometry shader to create a placeholder
object that contains no geometry, but a bounding box (and
optionally a motion bounding box and a maximum displacement), and a
callback installed with <i><a href="node189.html#INDEX948">mi_api_object_callback</a></i>. When mental
ray hits the bounding box of this placeholder, it will call the
callback, which must then build the same object again, only this
time with the real geometry instead of just installing the
callback. Placeholder objects may contain only a single
<a href="node83.html#mi:group">object group</a>. This has the advantage
that objects are not created unless, and when, they are actually
needed. When memory runs out, mental ray 3.0 can free up a lot of
memory by deleting the object - if necessary it can always call the
callback again to restore it. Finally, If there are several such
placeholder objects, and multiple CPUs, mental ray can process
callbacks in parallel. Placeholder objects are highly recommended
for complex geometry that would otherwise block a large chunk of
memory.</p>
