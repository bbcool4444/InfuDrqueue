<h3>Light Sources</h3>
<p>Photons are emitted from the light sources in the scene. It is
necessary to attach some extra information to each light source to
control the energy being distributed into the scene (and/or the
number of photons emitted).</p>
<p>To generate caustics from a particular light source, one must
specify the energy emitted by the light source. This is given by
the <i>energy</i> keyword. The energy is the flux distributed by
the light source and it will be distributed into the scene by each
photon which will carry a fraction of the light source energy. If
the energy is zero (the default), no photons will be emitted.</p>
<p>Another important factor is the number of photons to be
generated by this light source. This can optionally be specified
using the <i>caustic photons</i> keyword (10000 photons is the
default). This will be the number of photons stored in the
<a href="node48.html#INDEX96">photon map</a> and thus a good indication of
the quality of the generated caustics. It is also a direct
indication of the memory usage which will be proportional to the
number of photons in the <a href="node48.html#INDEX96">photon
map</a>. For quick, low-quality caustics, <tt>caustic photons
10000</tt> is adequate, for medium quality 100000 is typically
needed, and for highly accurate effects, <tt>caustic photons
1000000</tt> can be necessary. It is also possible to specify a
second integer, which is the maximum number of photons to be
emitted from the light source, or <i>only</i> the number of emitted
photons by setting the first integer to zero. By default there is
no upper limit (indicated by the value 0), in which case emission
will continue until the specified number of photons have been
stored. Notice that the emitted number of photons and the
preprocessing time is most often proportional to the number of
photons generated in the <a href="node48.html#INDEX96">photon
map</a>.</p>
<p>For most light sources, the distribution of energy using photons
will give the natural inverse square fall-off of the energy. This
might be an unwanted effect since some light shaders implement a
linear fall-off. It can be avoided by using the <i>exponent</i>
keyword. If the exponent is <i>p</i>, the fall-off is
<span class="math">1&nbsp;&frasl;&nbsp;r&nbsp;<sup>p</sup></span>, where
<i>r</i> is the distance to the light source. Exponent values
between 1 and 2 make the indirect light less dependent on distance.
Exponents of less than 1 is not advisable, as it often gives
visible noise. Exponent 2 is the default. Note that this violates
the conservation-of-energy law, and could cause bright spots from
distant light sources in unexpected locations.</p>
<p>The following is an example of a light that uses the
<tt>mib_light_point</tt> light shader and is capable of generating
caustics:</p>
<pre>
     light "caustic-light1" "mib_light_point" (
           "color"       1.0 1.0 0.95,
           "shadow"      on,
           "factor"      0.6,
           "atten"       on,
           "start"       16.0,
           "stop"        200.0
        )
        origin           20.0 30.0 -40.0
        energy           700 700 700
        caustic photons  100000
        exponent         1.5
     end light
</pre>
<p>An example of a light source which uses the inverse square
fall-off to compute illumination (and the default 10000 photons)
is:</p>
<pre>
     light "point1" "physical_light" (
           "color"       700.0 700.0 700.0
        )
        origin           20.0 30.0 -40.0
        energy           700 700 700
     end light
</pre>
<p>It is important to note the difference between <tt>color</tt>
and <tt>energy</tt>. <tt>color</tt> is the power of the direct
illumination, while <tt>energy</tt> will be the power of the
caustic. It is therefore possible to tune the brightness of
caustics to make them more or less visible.</p>
<p>If area light source information, such as a <tt>rectangle</tt>
statement, is added to the light source definition, both the direct
and global illumination will be emitted from an area light source.
This tends to make caustics more fuzzy.</p>
<p>To emphasize caustics, the energy of the light sources can be
higher than their colors (that determine the direct illumination).
If, for whatever reason, the user wants to have the sources of
caustics to be at different positions than the sources of direct
illumination, this is possible too. It might also be that a single
light source is sufficient for the caustics, while several light
sources are needed to fine-tune the direct illumination.</p>
