<h3>Hardware vs. Software Rendering</h3>
<p>
<span class="depr">Deprecated</span>
<p>
Ideally, software rendering algorithms should be translatable
directly to hardware. However, this is not possible because
hardware and software rendering use two very different
approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software rendering holds the 3D scene to be rendered (or the
relevant portions of it) in memory, and samples it pixel by pixel
or subpixel by subpixel. In other words, the scene is static and
always present, but the renderer deals with one pixel or subpixel
at a time.</li>
<li>Hardware rendering operates the opposite way. All pixels are
present at all times, but rendering consists of considering the
scene one triangle at a time, "painting" each one into the frame
buffer. The hardware has no notion of a scene; only a single
triangle is known at any one time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Software is completely unconstrained, except by performance
considerations, and can perform any algorithm whatever. The
subpixel loop method is chosen because it allows rendering nonlocal
effects that require considering different portions of the scene in
order to compute a single pixel or subpixel. For example,
reflections require access to both the reflecting and the reflected
object. A more complex example is global illumination, which
considers the indirect light from all surrounding objects to
compute the brightness of the subpixel being rendered. Hardware can
do none of this because it only ever knows one triangle at a time,
and has no notion of other objects.</p>
<p>Hardware rendering uses a limited range of workarounds to
address some of these limitations. These workarounds typically
involve pre-rendering objects into "maps", which are rectangular
pixel rectangles encoding properties of other objects and are
stored in the graphics hardware in the form of texture images.
While graphics hardware cannot deal with multiple objects, it can
deal very efficiently with texture images. Examples for such
mapping techniques are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shadow mapping renders the scene from the viewpoint of each
light source, recording only the depth of the frontmost object.
This can later be used during final rendering to decide whether a
point is in shadow, if it is farther away from the light than the
recorded depth. This approach does not work well for area lights
that cast <a href="node16.html#INDEX19">soft shadow</a>s (shadows
with fuzzy edges), and it cannot handle transparent objects such as
stained glass or smoke.</li>
<li>Reflection maps render the scene from the viewpoint of a
mirror. This image is then "pasted in" when the final render needs
to know what is seen in the mirror. This works only for flat or
near-flat mirrors.</li>
<li>Environment maps contain a hemispherical or otherwise complete
view of the surroundings as seen from the rendered scene. Nearby
objects are not normally included. Although environment maps
represent the scene poorly, and cannot capture the arrangement of
nearby objects at reasonable computational cost, they are
acceptable for highly curved reflectors such as chrome trims.</li>
</ul>
<p>Workarounds like this have one difficulty: they require a lot of
manual preparation and fine-tuning to work; for example, deciding
on a good environment map. The computer cannot do this because
while computing a correct map is possible, it would be very
expensive and easily defeat the expected time savings.</p>
<p>The driving force behind graphics hardware design is gaming,
which involves rendering as many triangles per second as possible
to a video screen. Also, procedural shading is still quite
primitive and requires workarounds as described above. This creates
some limitations of hardware rendering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rendered images go to a video screen. Retrieving them to the
main memory for further processing is often poorly optimized and
slow. This can be the main factor limiting frame rates.</li>
<li>To achieve full speed, the entire renderer must be carefully
hand-crafted to the scene being rendered. This cannot be done for a
general-purpose renderer.</li>
<li>Many effects beside the mapping workarounds described above
require rendering the scene multiple times because the complexity
of the effect exceeds the capacity of the hardware. This is called
"layering" and described in more detail below. This reduces the
achievable frame rates.</li>
<li>Multiple frame buffers are unavailable. Rendering to video only
requires RGBA video with low bit depth and a depth (Z) buffer.
General-purpose production rendering requires many frame buffers
with high bit depths.</li>
<li>Oversampling to reduce "staircase" aliasing is generally slow
and has poor quality. The subpixels computed are inaccessible; only
the final pixel is available.</li>
<li>There is no good approach to motion blurring. This is
critically important for film production.</li>
<li>Textures must be stored in the video hardware before use. The
available memory is usually 256 or 512 MB. Film production often
uses gigabytes of textures, which requires very slow paging.</li>
<li>Compatibility between the hardware from different vendors, and
even between successive hardware generations from the same vendor,
is very poor. Although OpenGL hides many differences, the most
advanced features and the fastest speed paths generally have not
found an abstraction in OpenGL yet. Hardware development cycles are
extremely rapid.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of this is mentioned in the literature and sales material
for graphics hardware boards. In general, it is unrealistic to
expect to attain advertised realtime frame rates, often over 100
frames per second, for general-purpose rendering without spending
the years of custom development that game designers generally
require.</p>
<p>Yet, despite all the limitations of hardware rendering, the
things it can do are done at extremely high speed, sometimes more
than a thousand times faster than software. Harnessing this speed
is the object of the hardware shading support in mental ray 3.3.
Although the limitations make it impossible to simply switch from
software to hardware rendering, much of the advantage can be
realized with an appropriate combination of hardware rendering and
software rendering, combining hardware speed with software
flexibility. This document describes how mental ray does this.</p>
