<h2>Dynamic Linking of Shaders</h2>
<p><a id="dynlink"></a>
Shaders are written as C or C++ subroutines,
stored in files with extensions like <tt>.c</tt> or <tt>.cpp</tt>.
To execute these shaders during rendering of a scene they must be
dynamically linked into mental ray at run time. mental ray accepts
shaders in three forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>As dynamically loadable shared library, further referred to as
<b><a id="INDEX361"></a>DSO</b>, or <em>Dynamic Shared Object</em>.
DSOs are supported on all major platforms. They have the special file
extension <tt>.so</tt> on Unix/Linux/MacOSX systems and <tt>.dll</tt>
on Windows systems. mental ray automatically substitutes <tt>.dll</tt>
for <tt>.so</tt> on Windows platforms and vice versa, so the same
library filename is accepted on any platform regardless of the actual
file extension.</li>
<li>Directly as <a href="node178.html#INDEX856">source code</a>.
The .mi file offers the <a href="node71.html#INDEX158">code</a>
statement, and the standalone application has a <tt>&minus;code</tt>
<a href="node245.html">command line</a> option.
Both accept a source file with a <tt>.c</tt> extension.</li>
<li><span class="depr">Deprecated</span>
In object format. Source files can be compiled<a id="INDEX359"></a> to
<a href="node166.html#INDEX843">object code</a>. This is the most common
form on systems that do not support DSOs; it is faster than source because
mental ray does not have to compile the shader. A compiler will create an
object file like <tt>myshader.o</tt> with the extension <tt>.o</tt> (or
<tt>.obj</tt> on Windows) in the current directory.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<a id="dso"></a>
Using DSOs is the fastest way to load shaders, there is very little overhead.
DSOs and object files are loaded using <tt>link</tt> statements in the scene
file or <tt>-link</tt> <a href="node245.html">command line</a> option.</p>
<p>
To create a DSO two steps are typically required:
</p>
<ul>
<li>compile the shader source to native object format,
<li>link the object file as a dynamically loadable library.
</ul>
<p>The commands to create a DSO depend on the operating system type.
To build a DSO named <i>example.so</i> or <i>example.dll</i>from a source file
<i>example.c</i>, the commands in the following section can be used in a shell
(outside an <dfn>IDE</dfn> or <em>Integrated Development Environment</em>, like
<em>Microsoft Visual Studio</em> or <em>Apple XCode</em>). The commands create
a performance optimized version of the shader for final rendering. Further
compiler options may be used to tune for specific requirements, like dedicated
target CPUs.</p>
<p>
During development phase of shaders it is useful to generate debug information
with the <tt>-g</tt> (<tt>/Zi</tt> on Windows) compiler option, and disable
compiler optimizations at the same time by omitting any <tt>-O</tt> or
<tt>/O</tt> options. On some platforms like Linux, <tt>-g</tt> and <tt>-O</tt>
can be combined, to find problems which may be introduced only during the
optimization process of the compiler. Refer to the compiler documentation of
the target platform for details.</p>

<p>Windows x86, cl (Microsoft Visual Studio Compiler)</p>
<pre>
cl /c /O2 /MD /W3 -DWIN_NT example.c
link /nodefaultlib:LIBC.LIB /OPT:NOREF /DLL /OUT:example.dll example.obj shader.lib
</pre>
<p>This applies to all Visual C++ 6, 7, 8, or 9, and Microsoft Platform SDK
compilers. The <tt>shader.lib</tt> <a href="#FOOTNOTE13">[13]</a> is a stub
library that is delivered together with mental ray. It is required to resolve
mental ray shader interface references at link time.</p>
<p>Additional options like <tt>/G6</tt> or <tt>/G7</tt> apply processor-specific
optimizations and may run certain code faster on that target CPU (only).</p>

<p>Windows x86, icl (Intel Compiler Suite)</p>
<pre>
icl /c /Ox /G7 /MD /W3 -DWIN_NT example.c
xilink /nodefaultlib:LIBC.LIB /OPT:NOREF /DLL /OUT:example.dll example.obj shader.lib
</pre>
<p>The <tt>/G7</tt> compiler option applies to special target CPU only,
and may need to be adjusted to benefit from capabilities of newer CPUs.</p>

<p>Windows x64, cl (Microsoft Visual Studio Compiler)</p>

</pre>
<p>The file <tt>example.exp</tt> is a user supplied export file for the
shader and must contain the names of the exported symbols to be seen by
mental ray, one entry per line. The file <tt>keep.exp</tt> is the list of
symbols exported by mental ray, either for use by shaders or for internal
linking purposes. It is supplied with mental ray and can be referenced using
an absolute path name. The optional file option <tt>extra.so</tt> needs to be
supplied only when functions from other shader libraries that are pre-loaded
during run time (such as <tt>physics.so</tt>) are used directly in the shader.

<br />
<p>To be able to compile and create DSOs requires that a C or C++
<a id="INDEX364"></a><b>development environment</b> is installed on the system.
If the <tt>cc</tt>, <tt>ld</tt>, <tt>cl</tt>, <tt>link</tt>, etc. commands are
not found, then the development environment may not exist or is not set up for
the user. On most platforms, such development tools are separate products that
must be purchased separately. Additionally, certain setup commands may need to
be executed prior to compilation, to establish environment variables and pathes
to the correct compiler, tools and system libraries. On the other hand, the
capability of dynamic loading a DSO does not require any compilers or
development options.</p>
<p>If a host machine supports multiple programming models, like running both
32bit and 64bit versions of software, the build options <em>must</em> agree
with the version of mental ray. The use of system commands like the Unix
<tt>file</tt> command applied to the mental ray executable and the shader
library will inform if they can work together. If there is a mismatch, the
system may emit error messages like:</p>
<pre>
/my/example.so: rld: Fatal Error: cannot successfully map soname '/my/example.so'
</pre>
<p>The runtime linker always tries to match executables and libraries, which
allows multiple target binaries to reside on the same system without conflicts.
If the filename of the DSO given as an absolute path name mental ray only tries
to load that particular file. If it is given as a relative path, mental ray
searches for the DSO in a list of paths, by default in
<tt>/usr/local/mi/lib;.</tt>. This list can be adjusted on the command line
of the standalone renderer (<tt>-ld_path</tt>) or an environment variable
(<tt>MI_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>). A search list is a semicolon-separated, or
colon-separated (Unix-like platforms) list of paths (Windows uses colons
for drive letters).</p>
<p>Note, that shader <a href="node178.html#INDEX856">source code</a> is
normally portable, unless non-portable system features (such as <i>fsqrt</i>
function on SGIs) are used. This means that the shader will run on all other
vendors' systems unchanged. If the compilation fails and therefore the shaders
are undefined, mental ray will return <tt>miFALSE</tt> for any calls of the
undefined shaders, which will generally leave the pixel sample black.</p>
<p>The binary DSOs (<tt>.so</tt> extension) or object files (<tt>.o</tt>
extension) are not portable. They must be compiled separately for each platform
and, usually, for each major operating system release. For example, a Linux
object file will not run on a Windows system even if they run on same type
of processor. Also note, that pointers are 32bit values on some systems and
64bit values on others, and that certain processors require that 64bit values
such as <tt>double</tt>s are stored at memory addresses evenly divisible by 8
(which is typically enforced by compiler defaults).</p>

<p>On SGI systems, a shader can be debugged after it has been called for the
first time, which attaches it to the program and makes its symbols available
to the debugger. For this to work, the <tt>-g</tt> option must be given to the
<tt>cc</tt> and <tt>ld</tt> commands in all stages - compilation, linking, and
shared-library building. Also, only DSO shaders are debuggable, not shaders
loaded in object ( <tt>.o</tt>) or source ( <tt>.c</tt>) form.</p>

<p>On older systems where debugging shaders in dynamically loaded objects is
difficult, or even to watch progress in regular shaders, it is helpful to use
<dfn><a href="node157.html#INDEX828">mi_info</a></dfn> or <dfn>
<a href="node157.html#INDEX830">mi_debug</a></dfn> calls in the shader code.
Direct calls to system functions like <i>printf</i> should be avoided because
the output is lost when running on a slave host, and because it can cause
problems when running on multi-threaded systems.</p>

<p>Windows shader libraries must use at least one shader interface call (any
C shader interface function beginning with <i>mi_</i>). Otherwise an error
message like "<code>DLL_SetModuleHandle not found</code>" may occur.</p>

<p>When a shared library is loaded that provides an externally visible function
<a id="INDEX365"></a><code>module_init()</code>, this function will be called
right after the library has been loaded, and before the first shader in it is
called. Conversely, if it contains a function <a id="INDEX366"></a><code>
module_exit()</code>, that function will be called just before the library gets
unloaded, and after the last call to a shader in this library. Note, that in
the case of non-recoverable errors at any time after the library was loaded the
<code>module_exit</code> is not guaranteed to be called. Neither
<code><a href="node100.html#INDEX365">module_init</a></code> nor
<code><a href="node100.html#INDEX366">module_exit</a></code> should rely on any
shader interface services that assume that a rendering operation is in progress.
Message functions such as <dfn><a href="node157.html#INDEX828">mi_info</a></dfn>
are available. Note, that this feature is not supported on IBM systems.</p>

<p>Note, that if a C++ compiler is used to compile a shader, all function names
intended to be visible to mental ray (shader, init, exit, version) need to be
declared with <tt>extern "C"</tt>. This is necessary because C++ compilers
"mangle" symbols by encoding type information into the exported name,
so mental ray cannot find the shader in the library. This will result in a
"<code>declaring nonexisting function</code>" warning, and the shader will not
be called.</p>

<p><a id="FOOTNOTE13">[13]</a> Windows is not able to resolve external symbol
references dynamically at load time only as supported by Unix-like platforms.
Therefore, the <code>shader.lib</code> library provides all the symbol names
of the mental ray shader interface functions to please the linker. At load time,
mental ray (Standalone, or Library in a DCC application) will resolve the stub
function references with the actual functions provided by the mental ray process,
thus performing a similar dynamic symbol searching as on Unix-based platforms.
</p>
<p><a id="FOOTNOTE14">[14]</a> The <code>-Bsymbolic</code> option is supported
by RedHat and SuSE Linux 8.0 and later. It makes it possible to use a different
standard C++ library in the shaders than in mental ray, even though both are
part of the same executable. This is important because mental ray uses a
lowest-common-denominator library that is likely to differ from the default
version used when compiling shaders.</p>
