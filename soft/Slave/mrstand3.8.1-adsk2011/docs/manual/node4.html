<h2>Introduction to mental ray</h2>
<p>mental ray is a general-purpose renderer which creates images of
exceptional quality and achieves high performance through the
exploitation of parallelism on both multiprocessor machines and
across networks of machines.</p>
<p>The software uses advanced rendering acceleration techniques
such as a <a href="node76.html#INDEX202">scanline rendering</a>
algorithms for fast primary visible surface determination and
<a href="node76.html#INDEX203">BSP</a> (<b><a id="INDEX1"></a>binary
space partitioning</b>) algorithms for
<h5 class="anchor" id="api:mi_api_code_byte_copy">mi_api_code_byte_copy</h5>
efficient rendering of ray tracing effects. These algorithms can be
fine-tuned by optional user-settable parameters to achieve even
higher performance than normally achieved by the built-in automatic
scene cost analysis.</p>
<p>mental ray supports caustics and global illumination simulation
using the Photon Map<sup>&trade;</sup> method. Caustics caused by
multiple reflections and/or <a href="node115.html#INDEX446">refraction</a>s,
caustics that are
themselves reflected or refracted, and volume caustics are
supported. Complete, physically correct simulation of general
global illumination is also supported: any combination of diffuse,
glossy, and specular reflection and transmission can be simulated,
such as color bleeding caused by diffuse interreflections, and
multiple volume scattering.</p>
<p>mental ray has been designed to take full advantage of parallel
hardware, including both <b><a id="INDEX2"></a>thread</b>
<a href="node6.html#INDEX6">parallelism</a>
on a single machine, and process level parallelism across networks
of machines, and on massively parallel distributed-memory systems.
mental ray takes advantage of thread parallelism automatically; the
use of other machines on the network as render slaves may be
configured by the user. The renderer balances the computational
load among the available processors using a distributed shared
database that distributes parts of the scene in an optimal way
based on demand.</p>
<p>mental ray can be combined with any suitable modeling and/or
animation system via the <tt>.mi</tt> file format, or by
integrating the library version into the modeling and animation
system, or by combining the library with a translator that reads
the modeling system's native file format and converts it directly
to mental ray scene description. Finally, mental ray is available
as a stand-alone program for batch-mode rendering.</p>
<p>In the standard standalone version, input is via a scene file in
ASCII format. The .mi format is the native scene description format
of mental ray. Supported geometric primitives include polygon and
triangle meshes, trimmed free-form surfaces, subdivision surfaces,
and hair. All geometry may be procedurally displaced.</p>
<p>Free-form surfaces may be input in non-uniform rational B-spline
(NURB), B&eacute;zier, Taylor, or cardinal form, or through the use
of basis matrices. Free-form surfaces may be of arbitrary degree.
The geometry of free-form surfaces may be further modified by the
application of trimming curves and displacement maps. Trimming
curves need not have the same representation as the surface.
Surfaces are triangulated internally using a variety of available
approximation techniques and quality criteria like distance of the
surface to the camera.</p>
<p>Connectivity information between free-form surfaces can be given
which will stitch surfaces together and close gaps. If the
connectivity is unknown, it can be automatically determined at
run-time.</p>
<p>mental ray supports efficient rendering of animations using
<a href="node60.html#INDEX110">incremental change</a>s to the scene
database. Only the parts of the scene that change from one frame to
the next need to be redefined. This feature allows mental ray to
optimize scene tessellation, preparation, acceleration data
structure management, and network transfers, taking advantage of
the time coherency of the animation.</p>
<p>The functionality of mental ray may be extended through runtime
linking of user-supplied C or C++ subroutines, called
<b><a id="INDEX3"></a>shader</b>s. Shaders can be used to create
geometric elements at runtime of the renderer, procedural textures,
including bump and displacement maps, materials, atmosphere and
other volume rendering effects, environments, camera lenses, and
light sources. The user has access to a convenient environment of
supporting functions and macros for use in writing shaders. The
parameters of a user-provided shader can be freely chosen with name
and type; user-defined shaders are not restricted to a list of
predefined parameters. Available parameter types include integers,
scalars, vectors, colors, textures, light sources, arrays, and
nested structures. When a user-defined shader is called, mental ray
will provide parameter values according to standard C calling
conventions.</p>
<p>Standard <a href="node79.html#INDEX242">material</a> shader
libraries provide a rich variety of parameters for describing
material properties, including ambient color, diffuse color,
specular color, transmission and shadow colors, a specular
exponent, reflectivity, and transparency coefficients, and an
<a href="node76.html#INDEX201">index of refraction</a>. The
standard physics shader library adds global illumination effects
and other physically correct simulations such as
<a href="node80.html#INDEX259">indirect illumination</a>,
<a href="node143.html#INDEX612">translucency</a>, glossy reflections, true
diffuse light transport (a sub-function of global illumination that
is often called "radiosity"), and color bleeding. Bump mapping and
displacement mapping are supported as well. The material parameters
are interpreted by the shader specified for the material. All
parameters may be mapped with one or more textures or other
shaders, by connecting shader inputs with other shaders outputs
resulting in complex shader graphs.</p>
<p>The illumination effects in mental ray are not hard-coded
features but they are all defined by shaders. New illumination
features, or variations of existing features, can be added simply
by writing new or modify existing shaders.</p>
<p>Furthermore, light which is passing through the free space
surrounding objects, as well as light passing through solid
objects, can be modified according to volume shaders. This allows
the creation of fog and non-homogeneous transparency effects as
well as visible light beams. In addition to standard material
<a href="node21.html#INDEX44">environment map</a>s, a global
environment map can be specified that provides a solid background
for rays leaving the scene.</p>
<p>The standard base, physics, and contour shader libraries are
available as <b><a id="INDEX4"></a>source code</b>
<h5 class="anchor" id="api:mi_eval_transform">mi_eval_transform</h5>
from <a href="ftp://ftp.mentalimages.com/pub/shaders/">ftp://ftp.mentalimages.com/pub/shaders/</a>.</p>
<p>mental ray can generate a variety of output formats, including
common picture file formats and special-purpose formats for depth
maps and label channels. Alpha channels are supported. Bit depths
of 8 and 16 bits per component are supported, as well as a 32-bit
floating-point component mode and RGBE HDR (high dynamic range)
images. User-supplied functions can be applied to the rendered
image before it is written to disk.</p>
<p>Contour lines can be rendered with mental ray. They can be
placed at discontinuities of depth or surface orientation, between
different materials, or where the color contrast is high, simply by
using an appropriate contour shader. The contour lines are
anti-aliased, and there can be several levels of contours created
by reflection or seen through semitransparent materials. The
contours can be different for each material, and some materials can
have no contours at all. The color and thickness of the contours
can depend on geometry, position, illumination, material,
<a href="node199.html#INDEX1061">frame number</a>, and various other
parameters as determined by the shader. The resulting image may be
<a href="node77.html#INDEX0">output</a> as a pure contour image, a
contour image composited onto the regular image (in raster form in
any of the supported formats), or as a PostScript file.</p>
<p><a id="INDEX5"></a> Phenomena consist of one or
<h5 class="anchor" id="api:mi_call_contour_material">mi_call_contour_material</h5>
more cooperating shaders or shader trees (actually, shader DAGs; a
DAG is a directed acyclic graph). A phenomenon consists of an
"interface node" that looks exactly like a regular shader to the
outside, and in fact may be a regular shader, but generally it will
contain a link to a shader DAG. mental ray takes care of
integrating all aspects of the phenomenon into the scene, which may
include the introduction or modification of geometry, introduction
of lenses, environments, and compile options, and other shaders and
parameters.</p>
<p>The Phenomenon concept is conceived to unify - by packaging and
hiding complexity - all those seemingly disparate approaches,
techniques, and tricks, most notably (but not limited to) the
concept of a shader, which are characteristic for today's state of
the art in high-end 3D animation and in digital visual effects
production. The aim is to provide a comprehensive, coherent, and
consistent foundation for the reproduction of all visual phenomena
by means of rendering. The Phenomenon concept provides the missing
framework for the completion of the definition of a scene for the
purpose of rendering in a unified manner.</p>
