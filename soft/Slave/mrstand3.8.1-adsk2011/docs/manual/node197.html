</pre>
<p>A translator must provide: either <tt>tf.function</tt> and
<tt>time</tt>, or <tt>global_to_local</tt> and
<tt>local_to_global</tt>; also <tt>item</tt> (using
<i>mi_scene_link</i>), <tt>param_decl</tt>, <tt>param_size</tt>,
and <tt>param</tt>.</p>
<p>All fields except the matrices, the material, and the parameters
are reserved for Scene and may not be modified by other modules.
The tags can be modified indirectly with the link and unlink
functions, which take care of reference counts. The instance
element has two variable parts; one for inherited shader parameters
and one for the relation list. The latter is maintained internally
by mental ray.</p>
<dl>
<dt>tf.function<dd>optionally points to a transformation
function that computes a matrix from the current time. If present,
this function is called during preprocessing with three parameters:
a pointer to the result global-to-local matrix, the instance tag,
and the time as given in the preprocessing control structure.

<dt>tf.time<dd>is the time the evaluation function, if present,
was last called with. If it matches the current time, the matrices
need not be calculated by calling the function again.

<dt>tf.global_to_local<dd>transforms the parent space to the
local space of the instanced subtree. If a transformation functions
exists, it writes its result here; if not, the translator must
store an appropriate matrix here.

<dt>tf.local_to_global<dd>is the inverse matrix, set by Scene
after the transformation function (if it exists) has returned the
<tt>tf.global_to_local</tt> matrix.

<dt>tf.identity<dd>is <tt>miTRUE</tt> if the transformation
matrices in this instance are identity transforms (this saves the
renderer unnecessary ray transformations).

<dt>tf.id<dd>is a unique transformation ID. Scene creates it
during preprocessing, trying to assign identical IDs to identical
transformations. This is especially important for
<a href="node180.html#INDEX862">leaf instance</a>s: the renderer does not
have to re-transform the current ray if the new box has the same
transformation (same ID) as the previous.

<dt>motion_transform<dd>specifies the transformation from parent
space to local space for motion blur transforms. If this is a null
matrix, the instance transformation <tt>tf</tt> is used.

<dt>item<dd>is the tag of the element being instanced. Only
groups, cameras, lights, objects, or functions can be referenced.
If a function (or function list) is supplied, mental ray will call
them during scene preprocessing as
<a href="node179.html#INDEX857">geometry shader</a>. They must return a
single object tag, which may (and often should) be a placeholder
object.

<dt>material<dd>is either a material (if <i>mtl_array_size</i>
is 0) or a material list (if <i>mtl_array_size</i> is nonzero) used
for material inheritance (as opposed to parameter inheritance).
During scene preprocessing, the non-null material tag closest to a
geometrical object (lowest in the DAG hierarchy) becomes the
default material for any polygon or surface in the object that does
not have its own non-null material tag. If the tag references a
list (type <tt>miSCENE_TAG</tt>) or materials, it is expected to
contain <i>mtl_array_size</i> tags, which will be indexed with the
polygon or surface label during rendering. (The <i>mtl_override</i>
flag modifies the inheritance rules, see below.)

<dt>mtl_array_size<dd>specifies the number of tags in the
material tag list if nonzero. If the material tag specifies a
material directly, it must be zero. This number is used during
rendering as a flag that tells mental ray that the material tag
references a list, and also how many items there are in the list to
prevent array bounds overflows.

<dt>boxes<dd>is used by mental ray internally to store
tessellation results in <a href="node180.html#INDEX862">leaf
instance</a>s created during preprocessing.

<dt>next<br>
prev<dd>are used by mental ray internally to
chain <a href="node180.html#INDEX862">leaf instance</a>s created
during preprocessing.

<dt>light_obj_ring<dd>is used internally by mental
ray to keep track of <a href="node123.html#INDEX486">geometric area
light source</a>s.

<dt>userdata<dd>allows attaching a user data block (miUserdata)
or a chain of user data blocks. Shaders can retrieve the data with
<i>mi_query</i>.

<dt>label<dd>stores an opaque integer set by the scene file with
a <tt>tag</tt> statement.
<dt>geogroup<dd>is used internally to point to the group element
which contains all the geometry-shader created scene elements for
this instance.

<dt>off<dd>if true, stops the recursive descent during
preprocessing as if the instance and its instanced item didn't
exist. This is useful for temporarily suspending subtrees without
deleting them. It implements the <tt>hide</tt> flag in the .mi
scene language.

<dt>gen_motion<dd>specifies that motion blur should be generated
for the instance. Setting this field to <tt>miGM_OFF</tt> switches
off motion blur for this instance. Motion blur is always generated
when this field is set to <tt>miGM_TRANSFORM</tt>. The parent
instance determines whether motion blur is active or not when
gen_motion is set to <tt>miGM_INHERIT</tt> here.

<dt id="instance_flags">visible
<br>shadow
<br>transparency
<br>reflection
<br>refraction
<br>finalgather
<br>caustic
<br>globillum
<br>select
<dd>instance flags or modes to control rendering properties.
A simple flag is a boolean value to switch a single property
(<var>visible</var>, <var>select</var>). Most of the flags provide control
of sub-properties like <dfn>cast</dfn> and <dfn>receive</dfn>, which is
encoded in a <var>mode</var> bitmap. See below for details on the individual
flags.
<dd class="note">Note, that <em>"cast this effect"</em> typically means to
<em>"be visible to this type of ray"</em>, and <em>"receive this effect"</em>
means <em>"cast this type of ray"</em>.
<dd>
The flags are inherited down the scene DAG in such a way that flags in lower
DAG instances take precedence. During scene pre-processing, any non-null flag in
the DAG instance closest to a geometrical object (lowest in the DAG hierarchy)
is put into the <a href="node180.html#INDEX862">leaf instance</a>. Before
rendering starts the <a href="node180.html#INDEX862">leaf instance</a> flags
are merged with the object flags to define the final properties; and they are
stored in internal raylib rendering data structures. Note, that for all the
flags the value <code>0</code> means <em>"nothing set"</em> or
<em>"no override"</em>, which is the default.
<dd>
<dl>
<dt>visible
<br>select<dd>
Simple flag to control primary visibility and selectability.
In the merging operation of the instance with object flags, the boolean flag
is treated as a "tri-state boolean", hence represented as an integer (with only
2 lowest bits recognized) with the values:
<table class="table">
<tr><th>value<th>meaning</tr>
<tr><td><code>0</code><td>not set (but use inherited value)</tr>
<tr><td><code>1</code><td>enable</tr>
<tr><td><code>2</code><td>disable</tr>
</table>
In other words, <code>0</code> means that just the object flag is taken,
<code>1</code> enables the property even if the object has disabled it, and
<code>2</code> disables it even if the object has the flag set.
<dt>shadow
<br>reflection
<br>refraction
<br>transparency
<dd>
These flags are mode bitmaps which control cast and receive properties of the
rendering effect separately. The lowest 4 bits of the integer field are
recognized as follows:
<table class="table">
<tr><th>bit<th>meaning</tr>
<tr><td><code>0</code><td>enables casting (from this object)</tr>
<tr><td><code>1</code><td>enables receiving (from other objects)</tr>
<tr><td><code>2</code><td>disables casting</tr>
<tr><td><code>3</code><td>disables receiving</tr>
</table>
If no bit is set then this instance does not enforce any changes of flags
on the object. Typical values are:
<table class="table">
<tr><th>value<th>force</tr>
<tr><td><code>1</code><td>cast</tr>
<tr><td><code>2</code><td>receive</tr>
<tr><td><code>3</code><td>all (cast and receive)</tr>
<tr><td><code>4</code><td>no cast</tr>
<tr><td><code>6</code><td>receive-only (no cast but receive)</tr>
<tr><td><code>8</code><td>no receive</tr>
<tr><td><code>9</code><td>cast-only (no receive but cast)</tr>
<tr><td><code>12</code><td>none (no cast nor receive)</tr>
</table>

<dt>finalgather
<br>caustic
<br>globillum
<dd>Similar to above, but these effects support two more bits that are
recognized as follows:<br>
<table class="table">
<tr><th>bit<th>meaning</tr>
<tr><td><code>0</code><td>enables casting (from this object)</tr>
<tr><td><code>1</code><td>enables receiving (from other objects)</tr>
<tr><td><code>2</code><td>disables casting</tr>
<tr><td><code>3</code><td>disables receiving</tr><tbody>
<tr><td><code>4</code><td>hide object from effect</tr>
<tr><td><code>5</code><td>make visible to effect</tr>
</table>
The extra bits allow to completely hide objects from final gathering or photon
tracing without touching the other bits; they have higher priority and
will be checked first by mental ray. In other words, the lower bits only take
effect if the higher bits are enabling and not disabling the object at all.
Bit masking operations can be used to set these higher bits only, like:
<pre>inst&rarr;finalgather |= hide ? 0x10 : 0x20;</pre>
This implements the <code>on|off</code> syntax in the .mi scene language for
these flags.
</dl>

<dd class="note">The <var>reflection</var>, <var>refraction</var>, and
<var>finalgather</var> flags replace the former <var>trace</var> flag. Code
that used to write to the <code>trace</code> field must now write to these
three flag bitmaps instead.

<dt id="api:face">face<dd>controls face culling.
<a id="INDEX1060"></a> The possible values are <tt>'f'</tt> (front),
<tt>'b'</tt> (back), and <tt>'a'</tt> (all). If not specified, the
culling flag given in the options or in the state is used.

<dt>temp_material<dd>is an internal flag that tells SCENE
postprocessing that the material field contains a material that was
created during preprocessing, and must be deleted on
postprocessing. This happens if the <a href="node76.html#INDEX224">inheritance
function</a> sets one or more of
the material fields in its material argument, to implement CATIA
aspect inheritance.

<dt>mtl_override<dd>changes the inheritance rules for the
material or material list stored in this instance. If true, and
materials exist, this instance will override materials in instances
lower in the DAG and in the object, instead of allowing lower
materials to override higher ones. This is useful for implementing
highlighting selections.

<dt>history_size<dd>is set in <a href="node180.html#INDEX862">leaf instance</a>s,
so that the <a href="node76.html#INDEX224">inheritance function</a> or
<a href="node76.html#INDEX225">traversal function</a> can use
the <tt>miLEAFHISTORY</tt> macro to access the inheritance history,
beginning at the scene root group (0), followed by the instance in
the root group that led to the current location in the DAG (1), all
the way to the current instance (history_size - 1). The macro
accepts one integer argument (0 for root group etc.) and returns a
tag. For example, this is useful in inheritance functions for
comparisons to a selection list and then setting a highlight
material and <i>mtl_override</i> on a match.

<dt>approx_list<dd>implements flagged approximation inheritance.
If nonzero, it is a tag of an element of type
<tt>miSCENE_APPROX_LIST</tt> holding up to 10 approximations, in
the order visible, trace, shadow, caustic, globillum, displace
visible, displace trace, displace shadow, displace caustic, and
displace globillum. Approximations with multiple flags are stored
in multiple slots. Unused slots have style
<tt>miAPPROX_STYLE_NONE</tt> (see miApprox below).

<dt>approx_override<dd>, if set, causes instances higher in the
scene graph (closer to the root group) to override lower instances
and object approximations.

<dt>hardware<dd>specifies that the subtree must be rendered
using OpenGL hardware.

<dt>shadowmap<dd>specifies that the object casts shadows into
shadowmaps, if the shadow flag is enabled as well.

<dt>param_decl<dd>points to a parameter declaration that
describes the parameters. If parameters exist, this tag must be set
by the translator to allow data exchange with other hosts. If it is
missing, no data will be swapped regardless of the remote host's
byte order. In <a href="node180.html#INDEX862">leaf instance</a>s,
Scene stores the most recent parent instance's parameter
declaration tag here.

<dt>param_size<dd>is the size of the parameters in bytes. It is
taken from the first and only argument of the create and resize
calls. In the <a href="node180.html#INDEX862">leaf instance</a>,
the <a href="node76.html#INDEX224">inheritance function</a>
determines the size.

<dt>param<dd>is an arbitrary-sized array of parameters stored by
the translator. During preprocessing, the DAG is traversed, and the
parameters are passed to an <a href="node76.html#INDEX224">inheritance
function</a> that is called for
every instance found during traversal. The end result is stored in
the <a href="node180.html#INDEX862">leaf instance</a> by Scene.
