<h3 id="mi:assembly">Assemblies</h3>
<p>
Assemblies provide an encapsulation for entire subscenes. The key feature
of assemblies is on-demand loading and unloading, which reduces memory
consumption and allows faster rendering. An assembly subscene contains
a complete scene sub-graph consisted of objects, instances, groups,
textures, userdata, shaders, materials and other elements. Cameras,
options and lights defined in assembly are ignored.</p>
<p>Assemblies can either be defined in separate files, or created
procedurally.</p>
<p>Assembly is created or loaded when its bounding box is hit by a ray or
when the bounding box overlaps a tile in the rasterizer renderer. For this
reason, mental ray needs to know the bounding box of an assembly, which
should be as tight as possible for the best performance and memory
consumption.</p>
<p>Assemblies are instantiated similar to objects. The main scene
should contain a stub with the following syntax:</p>
<pre>
    assembly "assembly_name"
        box [<i>x<sub>min</sub> y<sub>min</sub> z<sub>min</sub> x<sub>max</sub> y<sub>max</sub> z<sub>max</sub></i>]
        [ motion box [<i>x<sub>min</sub> y<sub>min</sub> z<sub>min</sub> x<sub>max</sub> y<sub>max</sub> z<sub>max</sub></i>] ]
        file "<i>file_name</i>"
    end assembly
</pre>
<p>The individual parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The <tt>box</tt> statement specifies a bounding box for the assembly,
<b>in the space of the assembly</b>. It is the union of all bounding boxes
of all geometric objects defined in the assembly and transformed to the
assembly space. The <tt>box</tt> parameter must always be specified since
it is not possible to compute the bounding box without loading the assembly.
</li>
<li>
The <tt>motion box</tt> is similar to the box, but contains the minimum and
maximum components of all <a href="node32.html#IDEX62">motion vector</a>s and
transforms. For assemblies with motion, the motion box <b>has to be</b> be
specified. Unlike object motion bounding box, the assembly motion bounding
box should take into account not only object motion vectors, but also motion
transforms inside of the assembly.</li>
<li>
The <tt>file</tt> statement specifies the name of the file where the subscene
is stored in. A list of directories for looking up the file can be specified
with a <a href="node245.html#cli:assembly">command line option</a>, with a
<a href="node72.html#reg:assembly">registry variable</a>, or with the
<tt>MI_ASSEMBLY_PATH</tt>
<a href="configuration.html#env:assembly">environment variable</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike objects, assemblies do not have <code>trace</code>,
<code>visible</code> and similar flags. Those flags need to be defined on an
<code>instance</code> of an assembly.</p>
<p>An assembly file uses the usual mental ray scene file syntax, with one
exception: instead of the <tt>render</tt> directive, an assembly files ends
with a <tt>root</tt> statement to specify a single group which will be
attached to the main scene DAG when an assembly is loaded:</p>
<pre>
    root "group_name"
</pre>
<p>
For compatibility reasons, a <code>render</code> statement can be used
instead of the root statement (in which case camera and options are ignored).</p>
<p>
Assemblies can also be created procedurally, detailed description is given
in the <a href="assembly_api.html#api:assembly">Assembly API</a> section.</p>
<p>
Materials defined in an assembly should reference lights defined in the
main scene only. This requirement is due to the fact that the rendering kernel
would not be aware of them until all of the assemblies are loaded in order to
apply lights on an object from a different assembly or from the main scene.</p>
<p>
Transforms, flags, materials and light lists can be inherited from the main
scene to an assembly.</p>
<p>
An entire assembly is unloaded automatically if mental ray is running low
on physical memory. However, a scene could consist of few assemblies only.
Especially for scenes using ray tracing and global illumination, the spatial
coherency of traced rays is very low. This could lead to frequent loading and
unloading of assemblies, which is computationally expensive. In order to
improve the performance, it is strongly recommended to use placeholder objects
inside of the assemblies. If placeholder objects are used and mental ray is
running low on memory, mental ray would first unload the results of placeholder
object callbacks, but keep the assembly structure. Individual objects are much
faster to recreate than entire assemblies.</p>
<p>
For assemblies loaded from files mental ray provides on demand loading of
individual objects automatically. For procedurally created assemblies, it is
strongly recommended to write geometry shaders with assembly callbacks in such
a way that object placeholder callbacks are registered.</p>
<p>
Nested assemblies are currently not supported.</p>
