<h3 id="whatsnew">What's new in Version 3.8</h3>

<p>Here is a summary of some of the new features and feature
improvements in version 3.8 of mental ray. Please refer to the
<a href="../relnotes/relnotes.html">release notes</a> for more
details and for other changes which are not mentioned here.</p>

<h4 id="iray">iray Rendering Mode on Graphics Hardware</h4>
<p>
This version offers a new rendering mode which generates photo-real
imagery using ray tracing technology to also capture global illumination
without introducing rendering algorithm specific artifacts and without
requiring the use of renderer specific parametrization. When coupled
with highly parallel processing platforms, like CUDA-capable hardware,
mental ray can deliver these results in a progressive manner, at
interactive frame rates. This mode is called the
<a href="iray.html#fo:iray">iray rendering mode</a>. It will be enabled
with a <a href="#mi:iray">string option</a>.
See also <a href="limitations.html#iray">Known Limitations</a>.</p>

<h4 id="metasl">MetaSL 1.1 Features Support</h4>
<p>
This version of mental ray adds runtime support for the features listed
in the MetaSL language specification version 1.1, as published on the
<a href="http://www.mentalimages.com/metasl">mental images website</a>.
This includes handling of newly introduced material descriptions and BRDF
properties, as well as support for scene data access from within MetaSL
shaders, for example. See also <a href="limitations.html#metasl">Known
Limitations</a>.</p>

<h4 id="deploy">MetaSL Unified Automatic Shader Deployment</h4>
<p>
The MetaSL back-end technology for automatic compilation and execution of
shader delivered as source code has been improved and extended. In addition
to the existing <a href="node99.html#sh:metaslc++">C++ back-end</a> a new
<a href="node99.html#sh:metaslllvm">LLVM back-end</a> is available. It provides
a platform independent way of deployment and shader execution without the
need for external compiler or framework installations. Furthermore, a newly
added mechanism for shader caching allows to support incremental MetaSL
shader editing workflows within mental ray.
See also <a href="limitations.html#metasl">Known Limitations</a>.</p>

<h4 id="stereo">Stereoscopic Rendering</h4>
<p>
mental ray supports <a href="node28.html#fo:stereo">stereoscopic rendering</a>
in a single run with optimal performance. It will generate the two images
for the left and the right eye automatically. Only the primary rendering
algorithms like rasterizer and ray tracing (of eye rays) are effected by
the slight offset of the eye. Secondary effects with view dependency like
tessellation or final gathering are not affected but use the "center" eye
as usual. The stereo rendering should not influence existing shaders. The
mental ray display protocol has been extended to send stereoscopic information
across the connection, and the image tools have been updated accordingly to
cope with stereo image files and to display images life when rendering in
stereo. The stereo rendering is enabled with a <a href="#mi:stereo">camera
setting</a>.</p>

<h4 id="raydiff">Dynamic Texture Filtering</h4>
<p>
Shaders are able to implement better texture filtering with the help of
so-called <em>ray differentials</em> that are natively supported by mental
ray. It allows to take advantage of dynamic filter sizes to reduce artifacts,
especially in secondary effects like reflections and refractions. Additional
<a href="#shader_texfilter">texture lookup shader API functions</a> allow to
improve existing texture filtering implementations with little effort.</p>

<h4 id="ipfg">Importance-based Final Gathering</h4>
<p>
The <a href="node52.html#fo:finalgather">final gathering</a> (FG) algorithm
can now be used together with
<a href="importons.html#fo:importons">Importons</a>, or even with
<a href="irradparticles.html#fo:ip">Irradiance Particles</a> (IP), to benefit
from importance-based computations of those techniques. These combinations
are enabled simply by activating both FG and Importons, or FG and IP, which
were rejected in previous versions. During rendering, after Importons or IP
passes have been finished, the FG points are placed in the scene. If the FG
rays have to be shot around, they are not shot in a uniform way, but in the
importance-driven way dictated by the Importons, or the IP map (which is used
to compute in which directions to shoot more rays and in which ones less).
The general outcome of enabling FG with importance-based techniques is better
final quality coupled with lower rendering times.</p>

<h4 id="bsp25">Ray Tracing Performance</h4>
<p>
The ray tracing acceleration algorithm BSP2 in mental ray has been revised
both in terms of memory usage and speed. It has been optimized especially for
handling dynamic scene content with on-demand loaded scene parts provided as
assemblies. In the case of motion blur with ray tracing, the memory consumption
has been reduced noticeably, with a positive impact on overall performance.</p>

<h4 id="hair">Hair Rendering Performance</h4>
<p>
A new acceleration technique for ray tracing hair has been implemented. It
leads to noticeable performance improvements both in terms of execution time
and memory consumption, especially in the presence of assemblies. When hair
is used with the rasterizer, a new mechanism can be enabled with a
<a href="#mi:rasthair">string option</a> which will decrease memory usage to
a fraction compared to previous versions, with the effect of rendering faster
by minimizing or even completely avoiding any flushing during rendering.
In addition, the default automatic splitting of long hair and large hair
counts has been re-designed and greatly improved, so that artifacts of
missing hair segments are gone, and tessellation behavior is more adaptive,
and memory efficient.</p>

<h4>Interactive Ray Tracing Support</h4>
<p>
The <a href="">progressive rendering</a> and <a href="ibl.html#fo:ibl">IBL</a>
algorithms have been improved and extended with capabilities to trade speed
for quality. This includes the introduction of a specialized
<a href="#mi:progress">occlusion cache</a> to pre-compute shadowing, as well
as support for <a href="#mi:iblapprox">approximations</a> of controllable
quality for the lighting contribution from the IBL environment. A new
integration interface has been designed for the implementation of interactive
rendering solutions, which allows to apply changes to the model while
receiving and displaying the rendered full resolution images at interactive
frame rates.</p>

<h4 id="maps">Map Container Features and Performance</h4>
<p>
The Map primitive adds support for attachment of <a href="">global data</a>.
This global data is made up of fields similar to the regular per-element
data, but there values are considered identical for all elements. The
runtime for handling Maps in mental ray has been extended with a caching
system to be able to operate on large Maps which can exceed the size of the
physical memory installed on a machine. The performance of Map accesses
has been improved noticeably.</p>

<h4>Advanced Unified Image Display</h4>
<p>
The image display tool <code>imf_disp</code> has been re-implemented based
on a unified user interface that looks identical on all supported platforms.
It provides identical workflow and interactions independent of the system.
It adds new features like exposure control (in addition to gamma control),
zoom display in and out, playback of animation sequences from a selection
of files, and anaglyph color viewing of stereo images. Furthermore, the
tools have been extended to report, display, and save separate layers in
multi-layer image files in OpenEXR format.</p>

<h3 id="mi">Scene Description Language</h3>

<p>
The following changes were made in the .mi scene description syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li id="mi:iray">The iray rendering mode can be enabled with a string option:
<pre>
"iray" on<dfn>|</dfn>off
</pre>
The default is <code>off</code>.

<li id="mi:stereo">New interface for stereoscopic rendering. The camera definition
can be extended with the <code>stereo</code> statement:
<pre>
camera "<var>camera_name</var>"
   <dfn>...</dfn>
   stereo <var>method</var> <var>eyedistance</var>
end camera
</pre>
The <var>method</var> is one of <code>off</code>, <code>toein</code>,
<code>offset</code>, or <code>offaxis</code>. The <var>eyedistance</var>
is the distance between the two eyes. See the camera parameter
<a href="node77.html#mi:stereo">stereo</a> for details.

<li id="mi:rasthair">
The improved rasterizer hair memory handling can be enabled with the
string option:
<pre>
"rast hair disposable" on
</pre>
The default is <code>off</code>.

<li>
The progressive IBL enhancements provide the following new options for
performance tuning towards specific use cases and models. They are
active only if the IBL <a href="node76.html#mi:ibl">lighting mode</a>
is set to <code>"approximate"</code>.
<pre>
"environment lighting approximate split" <dfn>num<sub>int</sub></dfn>
</pre>
Reduce color noise by drawing more samples internally from the environment
at the cost of bias if the value specified is > 1. The default is 4.
<pre>
"environment lighting approximate split vis" <dfn>num<sub>int</sub></dfn>
</pre>
Specify the number of visibility rays to be shoot per internal sample.
Reduces the visibility noise at he cost of increased ray tracing overhead.
The default is 2.
<pre id="mi:progress">
"progressive occlusion cache points" <dfn>num<sub>int</sub></dfn>
</pre>
Specify the number of points in the cache, 0 disables the cache.
The default is no cache.
<pre>
"progressive occlusion cache rays" <dfn>num<sub>int</sub></dfn>
</pre>
Specify the number of occlusion rays to shoot per point. Higher numbers
increase precomputation time. The default is 128.
<pre>
"progressive occlusion cache max frame" <dfn>num<sub>int</sub></dfn>
</pre>
Last frame that shall use the cache, later frames will blend in the regular
IBL. The default is 32.
<pre>
"progressive occlusion cache exclude" <dfn>num<sub>int</sub></dfn>
</pre>
Allows to exclude an object with the given label from being included in
the cache. The default is not exclude anything.

</ul>

<h3 id="shader">Shader Writing and Integration</h3>
<ul>
<li>
The <code>miCamera</code> structure has been extended with the new fields
<code>miCamera_stereo</code> and <code>eye_separation</code> for
stereoscopic rendering.
<li>
For stereoscopic rendering, image file names are automatically prefixed with
"lft_" and "rgt_", respectively. This implies that stereo buffers are currently
always written to separate files.
<li id="shader_texfilter">
For texture filtering with dynamic filter scale, and texture filtering on demand
the new functions <code>
<a href="node150.html#api:mi_lookup_color_texture_x">mi_lookup_color_texture_x</a>
</code>,<code>
<a href="node150.html#api:mi_lookup_filter_color_texture_x">mi_lookup_filter_color_texture_x</a>
</code>, and<code>
<a href="node150.html#api:mi_lookup_scalar_texture_x">mi_lookup_scalar_texture_x</a>
</code>
have been added.
<li>
For new dynamic texture filtering based on ray differentials, the new C++ class
<code>mi::shader_v3::Mip_remap</code> has been added.
</ul>

<h3 id="incompatible">Incompatible Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Due to changes in the handling of shader parameter connections and adjustments
in the implementation of the related <code>mi_eval</code> macros in mental ray,
existing shader packages for earlier versions of mental ray are not binary
compatible and need to be re-compiled. On the other hand, no source code
changes are required if just public interface functions have been used.
