<h3 id="whatsnew">
What's new in Version 3.6</h3>

<p>Here is a summary of some of the new features and feature
improvements in version 3.6 of mental ray. Please refer to the
<a href="../relnotes/relnotes.html">release notes</a> for more
details and for other changes which are not mentioned here.</p>

<h4>Assemblies</h4>

<p>An assembly is a subscene attached to a bounding box, which is
loaded on demand when the bounding box is hit by a ray, or is
contained and not completely occluded in a rendering tile, if the
rasterizer is used. In cases of insufficient memory, assemblies are
unloaded automatically and reloaded the next time they are
required.<br />
An assembly may contain all scene DAG elements, such as objects,
instances and groups, as well as textures, materials, shaders,
phenomena, lightprofiles and other scene elements. Lights and
cameras can be contained in an assembly, but they will be ignored
in the rendering process. An assembly can be created procedurally
as a result of geometry shadercall, or loaded from a <tt>.mi</tt>
file. See also <a href="#limitations">Known Limitations</a>.

<h4>New BSP Acceleration Technique</h4>

<p>A new BSP acceleration technique (BSP2) has been developed for
efficient rendering of large BSP trees. The new technique does not
require manual tuning for BSP traversal performance and memory
consumption improvements. The memory requirements are much lower
compared to the traditional BSP. Thus, the new BSP2 is recommended
for rendering of large scenes, like those which do not fit into the
physical memory of a machine, and scenes containing assemblies.</p>

<h4>New Subdivision Surface Support</h4>

<p>This <strong>completely new subdivision surface
implementation</strong> is based on a mixed triangle-quad
subdivision scheme. The new implementation is <strong>several times
faster</strong> than the previous one, at a reduced feature set
compared to the full hierarchical subdivision surface support. The
new code path is used for triangle-quad <code>ccmesh</code> input
objects not containing features listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>semi-sharp creases</li>
<li>vertex features</li>
<li>arbitrary polygons (not only triangles and quads) in
<code>ccmesh</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For objects containing containing one of the above features or
other types of approximations, the mental ray 3.5-based subdivision
surface implementation is used.<br />
The following approximation types are supported by the new
implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>parametric</code></li>
<li><code>[fine] [view] length [min max]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>See also <a href="#limitations">Known Limitations</a>.

<h4>Importons</h4>

<p>Importons are "particles" similar to photons. However, they are
shot from the camera and traverse the scene in the opposite order.
Instead of "energy", they hold a quality which is an importance of
the contribution to the final image. The information from importons
is used by the kernel for distribution of rendering efforts
according to the final contribution to the rendered image, i.e.
so-called importance-driven sampling. Importons are thus a
foundation for new view-dependent indirect illumination techniques.
As a first of them, mental ray 3.6 adds an importance-driven photon
map described below.</p>

<h4>Importance-driven Photon Maps</h4>

<p>A new technique based on the importon map described above has
been implemented. This technique is superior to the photon merging
introduced in mental ray 3.5. If importons are enabled, they are
used to control the density of the globillum photon maps and to
improve the lookup time.</p>

<h4>Native Ambient Occlusion with Caching</h4>

<p>A native implementation of ambient occlusion has been added,
which can be used by shaders to replace custom probe ray tracing
solutions and benefit from advanced features like caching.
See also <a href="#limitations">Known Limitations</a>.

<h4>MetaSL Support</h4>

<p>MetaSL is a powerful shading language targeting current and
future shading requirements. mental ray shading functionality has
been extended to allow efficient support for the MetaSL shaders. It
is possible to use a mixture of native and MetaSL shaders in the
same scene. It is also possible to combine "native" software mental
ray shaders and MetaSL shaders in a shader tree or in a mental ray
Phenomena at rendering time.
See also <a href="#limitations">Known Limitations</a>.

<h4>Exact Final Gathering</h4>

<p>Added new finalgather mode <tt>"force"</tt>, where finalgather
map creation and interpolation will be disabled. A set of
finalgather ray will be shot each time
<tt>mi_compute_irradiance</tt> or <tt>mi_compute_avg_radiance</tt>
is called. The rendering speed would be much slower than in other
finalgather modes, delivering a superior image quality.</p>

<h4>Other improvements</h4>

<ul>
<li>Added support for frame buffer file caching, to store only fragments
of frame buffers in disk files on demand. See also <a href="#limitations">Known
Limitations</a>.
<li>Added support for the DDS image file format for single textures
and cubemaps. Internally cubemaps are stored as a single texture
containing all 6 faces.</li>
<li>For OpenEXR files, any number of buffers can be written to a
single file, including an arbitrary number of user buffers. All
files with the same output filename will be added to the same EXR
file. The primary buffer channels are named "R", "G", "B", and "A",
and all other buffers retain their buffer names, and get RGBA or
XYZ extensions, as appropriate. For example, a <code>rgba</code>
buffer named "diffuse" will have channels named "diffuse.R",
"diffuse.G", "diffuse.B" and "diffuse.A". If the camera is defined
with <code>output</code> statements instead of the new
<code>framebuffer</code> statements, then mental ray will
automatically assign names to the channels.</li>
<li>For the rasterizer and scanline rendering, significantly
improved performance for scenes with displacement, there a very
conservative value for the maximal displacement value was given and
the <tt>displace presample</tt> option was not used.</li>
<li>Significantly improved rasterizer performance for high depth
complexity scenes (such as scenes with hair) rendered with the new
transparency depth limit.</li>
<li>Fixed several issues with view dependent tessellation for
orthographic cameras.</li>
<li>For finalgathering, significantly reduced the requirement for
<strong>continuous</strong> memory block size. This may give memory
usage benefits on 32-bit machines rendering with large finalgather
maps.</li>
<li>For the rasterizer, increased the precision of the inversion of
transformation matrices. This reduces the differences between
images rendered on different platforms for transformations matrices
close to degenerate ones.</li>
<li>For the rasterizer, improved the statistics output.</li>
<li>New standard shader packages are delivered with mental ray:
<em>architectural</em> and <em>production</em>. They provide
shaders for creation of common materials typically used in
architectural and design applications, as well as shaders for
typical workflows used in visual effects production.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mi">Scene Description Language</h3>

<p>The following changes were made in the .mi scene description
syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li>New interface for named frame buffers. The camera definition in
the <tt>.mi</tt> file the following statement could be added:
<pre>
framebuffer "<var>name</var>"
    datatype "<var>string</var>"
    filtering <var>boolean</var>
    primary <var>boolean</var>
    user <var>boolean</var>
    filename "<var>string</var>"
    filetype "<var>string</var>"
    colorprofile "<var>string</var>"
    compression "<var>string</var>"
    quality "<var>string</var>"
    dod <var>boolean</var>
    dpi <var>int</var>
</pre>
The new syntax replaces file output statements. The old syntax is still
supported.</li>
<li>Added binary format for hair objects using the following
syntax:
<pre>
hair
    <var>...</var>
    scalar [ <var>&lt;number of scalars&gt;</var> ]
    binary `<var>&lt;binary block of scalars&gt;</var>`
    hair   [ <var>&lt;number of offsets&gt;</var> ]
    binary `<var>&lt;binary block of hair offsets&gt;</var>`
    <var>...</var>
end hair
</pre></li>
<li>Adding a file assembly to the main scene uses the following
syntax:
<pre>
assembly "<var>assembly_name</var>"
    box <dfn>[</dfn><var>min<sub>x</sub> min<sub>y</sub> min<sub>z</sub> max<sub>x</sub> max<sub>y</sub> max<sub>z</sub></var><dfn>]</dfn>
    <dfn>[</dfn> motion box <dfn>[</dfn><var>min<sub>x</sub> min<sub>y</sub> min<sub>z</sub> max<sub>x</sub> max<sub>y</sub> max<sub>z</sub></var><dfn>]</dfn <dfn>]</dfn>
    file "<i>file_name</i>"
end assembly
</pre>
<p>The individual parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <tt>box</tt> statement specifies a bounding box for the
assembly, <b>in the space of the assembly</b>. It is the union of
all bounding boxes of all geometric objects defined in the assembly
transformed to the assembly space. The <tt>box</tt> parameter must
always be specified since it is not possible to compute the
bounding box without loading the assembly.</li>
<li>The <tt>motion box</tt> is similar to the box, but contains the
minimum and maximum components of all motion vectors. For
assemblies with motion the motion box <b>must</b> be specified.
Unlike object motion bounding boxes, the assembly motion bounding
box should take into account not only object motion vectors, but
also motion transforms inside of the assembly.</li>
<li>The <tt>file</tt> statement specifies the name of the file
where the subscene is stored. A list of directories for looking up
the file can be specified with the <tt>-assembly_path
<i>path_list</i></tt> command line option, with the
<tt>{_MI_REG_ASSEMBLY}</tt> registry, or with the
<tt>MI_ASSEMBLY_PATH</tt> environment variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assemblies files should contain a root statement at the end:</p>
<pre>
root "<var>group_name</var>"
</pre>
The group <i>"group_name"</i> would be attached to the main scene
of the assembly.</li>
<li>The new BSP2 can be enabled with the <code>"acceleration
bsp2"</code> option in the <tt>.mi</tt> file.</li>
<li>The following string options can be used to specify global
defaults for ambient occlusion options:
<ul>
<li><tt>"ambient occlusion rays"</tt> sets the number of probe rays
shot at a shading point. The default value is 256.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The following string options can be used for controlling the
ambient occlusion cache:
<ul>
<li><tt>"ambient occlusion cache"</tt> enables the caching. If set
to <tt>off</tt>, the ambient occlusion passes are skipped and the
occlusion value is computed for each <tt>mi_ambient_occlusion</tt>
function call. The default is <tt>off</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>"ambient occlusion cache density"</tt> specifies the
maximal density of ambient occlusion points <i>after</i> all
refinement passes, in points per pixel. The default is 1 ambient
occlusion point per pixel.</li>
<li><tt>"ambient occlusion cache points"</tt> specifies the number
of ambient occlusion points used for interpolation. The default
value is 64.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the rasterizer, added a new string option <tt>"rast motion
factor"</tt>, float value. If set, it adjusts the effective shading
rate on moving objects. It can be used to improve rendering
performance for motion scenes without a visual quality
decrease.</li>
<li>For the rasterizer, added a string option <code>"rast
transparency depth"</code> and the corresponded
<code>-rast_transparency_depth</code> to limit the depth
complexity. For high depth scenes this option may be used to
significantly improve performance without noticeable changes to the
rendered image.</li>
<li>Added new boolean string option <tt>"contrast all buffers"</tt>.
If set, the contrast oversampling test is done based
on all color buffers, including user frame buffers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="shader">Shader Writing and Integration</h3>
<p>
The following changes were made in the shader and integration interfaces.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> All shaders and integrations should be recompiled
for mental ray version 3.6. Common data structures in the shader
interface and integration API have been changed, especially with
regard to assemblies. Shaders compiled for an earlier version of
mental ray may crash without error indication if they access
changed data structures in the shader interface.</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a new mi_query mode miQ_STAGE. Shaders may use the
resulting queried value to detect the current rendering stage. The
shader.h file lists possible values: normal tile rendering,
finalgather precomputing, ambient occlusion cache creation, photon
and importon emission and lightmapping.</li>
<li>Added a new function to support backwards compatible frame buffer
interface.
<pre>
miBoolean mi_api_framebuffer_add(
    miTag   buffertag,
    char   *datatypes,
    char   *filetype,
    float  *fileparams,
    char   *filename);
</pre>
which should be used for the C-style framebuffer API. It is not using the new
named frame buffers. The functions <tt>mi_api_output_file_parameter</tt> and
<tt>mi_api_output_file_def</tt> are deprecated. The parser has been changed
to use the new function. Here is an example how the new code should look like.
<pre>
void camera_set_output(
    miCamera*   camera,
    const char* datatype,   /* like "+rgba" */
    const char* filetype,   /* like "tif"  */
    const char* filename)   /* like "myfile.tif" */
{
    float file_options[8] = {
            0.0f, // QUALITY [jpg] or COMPRESS [exr]
            0.0f, // EVEN or ODD
            0.0f, // spare
            0.0f, // spare
            0.0f, // DOD
            0.0f, // spare
            75f,  // DPI
            0.0f  // spare
            };

    mi_api_framebuffer_add(
                    camera->buffertag,
                    mi_mem_strdup(datatype),
                    mi_mem_strdup(filetype),
                    file_options,
                    mi_mem_strdup(filename));
}
</pre>
</li>
<li>The shader/integration interface is extended with the <tt>Framebuffer</tt>
class for the new named frame buffers. The convenient wrapper classes
<tt>Access_fb</tt> and <tt>Edit_fb</tt> allow easy reading and manipulation
of the frame buffers though smart pointers.
<br />
For shaders, in order to get the frame buffer index needed for <tt>mi_fb_put</tt>
and <tt>mi_fb_get</tt> functions, the <tt>Framebuffer::get_index</tt> method
should be used in shaders as follows.
<pre>
const char* bufferName = ...;

if (bufferName) {

    mi::shader::Access_fb fb(state->camera->buffertag);

    size_t bufferIndex(0);

    if (fb->get_index(bufferName, bufferIndex)) {
        miUint index = (miUint) bufferIndex;

        mi_fb_put(state, index, ...);
        ...
        }
    } // invalidates scope of smart pointer
</pre>
For integrations, here is an example for iterating through frame buffers.
<pre>
miCamera* camera = ...;

if (camera) { // print the filename of all framebuffers

    mi::shader::Access_fb fb(cam->buffertag);

    size_t n_fbs(0);

    fb->get_buffercount(n_fbs);

    for (miUint i=0; i < n_fbs; i++) {
        const char* bname;
        const char* filename;
        fb->get_buffername(i, bname);
        fb->get(bname, "filename", filename);
        mi_info("filename %s", filename);
        }
    } // invalidating the scope of the smart pointer

if (camera) { // remove all framebuffers, and
              // create new primary frame buffer with file output

    mi::shader::Edit_fb fb(camera->buffertag);

    fb->reset();    // delete all buffers
    fb->set("first", "datatype", "rgba");
    fb->set("first", "filtering", true);
    fb->set("first", "primary", true);
    fb->set("first", "filetype", "tif");
    fb->set("first", "filename", "/tmp/image.tif");
    ...
    } // invalidating the scope of the smart pointer
</pre>
</li>
<li>For state shader called in <tt>miSHADERSTATE_STATE_INIT</tt>
mode, <tt>miState::type</tt> is initialized correctly. This may be
used by a state shader to detect photon emission, lightmap or
output shader stage.</li>
<li>The <tt>miState::cache</tt> is no longer used for intersection
optimization. The member is kept for compatibility reason, but
should be considered deprecated. The marker functionality (setting
<tt>miState::cache</tt> to 0 in order to allow certain shader types
to call ray-tracing functions as documented in
<a href="../manual/node106.html">the manual</a>) is still available. This
change gives a small performance improvement.</li>
<li>A new <tt>mi_query</tt> mode <tt>miQ_FUNC_IS_ROOT</tt> is
added. The <tt>miBoolean</tt> argument is set to <tt>miTRUE</tt> if
the shader called called directly by the kernel as a "root" of the
shader graph or phenomenon. A shader returning a large structure
could use it to prevent a possible crash from attaching it directly
to a material or light.</li>
<li>Light lists, when created, may specify the sampling cone by
providing an axis of the sampling cone and a cosine of the spread
angle, like in the code sample below:
<pre>
mi::shader::Interface* iface;
mi_query(miQ_RAY_INTERFACE, state, 0, (void*)&amp;iface);
auto_ptr&lt;MI::RAY::LightList&gt; llist(iface-&gt;createLightList(
                                      state, state-&gt;normal, 0.5));
for (mi::shader::LightIterator light = llist-&gt;begin();
     light != llist-&gt;end(); ++light) {
    while (light-&gt;sample()) {
        miColor c = light-&gt;get_contribution();
        // ...
    }
    if (light-&gt;get_number_of_samples()) {
        // ...
    }
}
</pre>
<p>This could be used for sampling lights from both sides of the
surface without the <tt>state-&gt;pri=0</tt> trick.</p>
</li>
<li>For the rasterizer, added new <tt>shading_samples</tt> field to
<tt>miObject</tt> and <tt>miInstance</tt>, which allows overriding
the global shading samples specified in the options. The
corresponded syntax in <tt>.mi</tt> file: <tt>shading samples</tt>
<i>float</i>.</li>
<li>Added the new <tt>importance</tt> field to <tt>miState</tt>. It
is propagated to child rays. For rendering quality/performance
improvements, a shader written for scenes using indirect
illumination may multiply this field by a certain factor before
calling <tt>mi_compute_irradiance</tt> or <tt>mi_trace_...</tt>
function. The factor may be chosen as an intensity of the color
with which the result of the function call would be added to the
result of the shader, or, in case of tracing multiple (glossy)
rays, as the inverse of the number of rays shot.</li>
<li>Added the new boolean field <tt>photons_only</tt> to the
<tt>miLight</tt> structure. If set, the illumination from the light
is treated as indirect. Light sampling of the light would return
black. To compensate, photons emitted from the light would stored
on the first bounce in addition to the second and further bounces.
For a physically correct scene, the illumination model is thus the
same.
<p>This option can be used for significant performance improvement
for scenes with a high number of low intensity lights: the length
of the light lists, and thus the number of light shader calls and
shadow rays is reduced significantly at the price of a larger
photon map.</p>
<p>The corresponding <tt>.mi</tt> syntax in the light section:
<tt>photons only <i>boolean</i></tt>.</p>
</li>
<li>Restored <tt>mi_img_type_query</tt> function in the shader
interface. For a given image type this convenience function returns
the number of components, and the number of bits per component. It
also sets values in the optional array of 4 booleans with <code>miTRUE</code>
or <code>miFALSE</code> if the related component is used or not.</li>
<li>For raylib integration: changed <tt>mi_disp_fbmap</tt> function
to return 0 if called with out of range index. In particular this
should simplify integration of the display callback in the
finalgather precomputing preview mode.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="incompatible">Incompatible Changes</h3>
<p>The following changes were made in mental ray 3.6 which are not
backwards compatible or which may cause different results than
previous versions of mental ray:</p>
<ul>
<li>The functions <tt>mi_api_output_file_parameter</tt> and
<tt>mi_api_output_file_def</tt> are deprecated, and the new function
<code>mi_api_framebuffer_add</code> should be used instead. The
original functions are still existing but don't perform any operations.
<li>The <code>miState-&gt;pri_idx</code>, the index of triangle in
the sub-object box, is removed. With the changes done for assembly
support, the <code>miState-&gt;pri</code> completely identifies a
primitive in a scene. Lightmap and some contour shaders should use
the new <code>miQ_PRI_INDEX</code> query mode to obtain the
triangle index. Lightmap shaders should use the new
<code>mi_state_set_pri</code> function to set the current triangle
index.</li>
<li>Some missing const qualifiers were added to the interface
functions. Compiler warnings or errors would indicated
unintentional usage and should be taken seriously. There is at
least one exception though: If GCC 4 is used, it may print out
warning on the <code>mi_tri_vectors</code>, which should be
ignored.</li>
<li>The <code>mi::shader:Interface</code> class now has the new
version 2. The new class is incompatible with the version 1 used in
mental ray 3.5. However, the interface version 1 is still supported
and can be obtained with <code>mi_ray_interface_version</code>, so
mental ray 3.5 shader will <b>not</b> need a recompilation due to
this change.</li>
<li>The camera space (in particular used in the the old
<code>.mi1</code> files) is no longer supported. The geometry will
be loaded correctly, but the texture spaces and other coordinate
systems may be wrong.</li>
<li>Grid acceleration is no longer supported. The main advantage of
grid was the low memory footprint in heavily multiply-instanced
scenes. The BSP2 acceleration technique with assemblies is a
superior replacement.</li>
<li>In the <code>miOptions</code>, the fields
<code>rapid_shading_samples</code>, <code>rapid_collect_rate</code>
and <code>rapid_motion_resample</code> are renamed to more
intuitive <code>rast_shading_samples</code>,
<code>rast_collect_rate</code> and
<code>rast_motion_resample</code> respectively.</li>
<li>For the integrators on Windows: setting binary mode on the
<i>stdin</i> is no longer applied. If raylib is integrated into a
standalone-style product which could be used in the pipe mode, the
mode must be set in the integrated code explicitly with the call:
<code>_setmode( _fileno(stdin), _O_BINARY)</code>.</li>
<li>mental ray 3.6 keeps file outputs and output statements
separately. All output image files are written out after all output
shaders are applied. Writing out a frame buffer to one file,
applying an output shader to that frame buffer and writing the
modified buffer to a different file is not possible.</li>
</ul>
