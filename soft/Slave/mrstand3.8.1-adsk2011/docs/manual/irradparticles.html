<h2 id="fo:ip">Irradiance Particles <span class="recent">3.7</span></h2>
<p>
This algorithm is a novel approach to compute global illumination based on
<dfn>importance</dfn> sampling, which tends to converge much faster to a
desirable quality than the existing solutions like
<a href="node48.html">global illumination</a> photon tracing combined with
<a href="node52.html#INDEX98">final gathering</a>.</p>
<p>
Before rendering starts, <a href="importons.html#fo:importons">importons</a>
are shot from the camera into the scene and collected as a new kind of particle,
called an <dfn id="fo:irradiance_particle">irradiance particle</dfn>. They
carry information about the amount of direct illumination coming in at their
position (hence the name "irradiance") and, optionally, the amount of indirect
irradiance incident at their position (if indirect passes are enabled). During
rendering, the stored particles are used to estimate the irradiance at a
shading point: if just direct illumination was collected for irradiance
particles, this is equivalent to one bounce of indirect lighting.</p>
<p>
The irradiance can also be interpolated from precomputed values at the
particle positions.

<p>
The irradiance particle algorithm simulates some but not all of the indirect
lighting interactions of the traditional global illumination algorithms in
mental ray. For this reason, if irradiance particles are enabled then mental
ray will turn off the global illumination photon tracing automatically if it
was activated. This is a common situation when external applications are asked
to generate mental ray scenes with photon shaders attached, which are needed
for importons. Caustics can be used together with irradiance particles because
they are used to capture indirect lighting effects that irradiance particles
cannot simulate. If both final gathering and irradiance particles are enabled
then final gathering is preferred and irradiance particles will be switched
off automatically.
<p>
Irradiance particles support a special IBL-style functionality which can be
enabled by setting the number of indirect passes to -1. In this case only the
environment map lighting but not diffuse bounces are taken into account.
If interpolation is disabled then only environment presampling map is build
and no further precomputation steps are required. If interpolation is enabled
then particles are emitted in the precomputation pass in a usual way, but used
as interpolation points only.
<p>
The irradiance particles feature is controlled by
<a href="node76.html#opt:ip">scene options</a> and
<a href="node245.html#cli:ip">command line</a> arguments of a standalone
mental ray.</p>
