<h2>Memory-Mapped Textures</h2>
<p>mental ray supports memory mapping of textures on all platforms.
<a id="INDEX37"></a>Memory mapping means that the
texture is not loaded into memory, but is accessed directly from
disk when a shader accesses it. There is no special keyword or
option for this; if a texture is memory-mappable, mental ray will
recognize it and memory-map it automatically. Only the map image
file format (standard extension <tt>.map</tt>, but mappable files
are recognized even if they have an extension other than
<tt>.map</tt>) can be mapped. See the
<a href="node38.html#SECTION36">Output Shaders</a> chapter for a list of
supported file formats.</p>
<p>Note that memory mapping is based on the concept that the image
data on disk does not require decoding or data type conversion, but
is available in the exact format that mental ray uses internally
during rendering. Normally mental ray will attempt to auto-convert
image data formats; for example if a color image file is given in a
<tt>scalar texture</tt> construct, mental ray will silently convert
the color pixels to scalars as the texture is read in. Most data
types are auto-converted to most other data types. This does not
work for memory-mapped textures because it would defeat the
purpose. This also applies to the byte order.</p>
<p>Memory mapping requires several preparation steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>The texture must be converted to <tt>.map</tt> format using a
utility like mental images' <a href="node249.html#INDEX1088">imf_copy</a>.
The scene file must be
changed to reference this texture. Note that mental ray recognizes
<tt>.map</tt> textures even if they have an extension other than
<tt>.map</tt>; this can be exploited by continuing to use the old
file name with the "wrong" extension, to avoid having to change the
scene file. When using <a href="node249.html#INDEX1088">imf_copy</a>,
the <tt>-p</tt> option is
highly recommended to create a texture pyramid in the file.</li>
<li>Memory-mapped textures are automatically considered
<tt>local</tt> by mental ray, as if the <tt>local</tt> keyword had
been used in the scene file. This means that if the scene is
rendered on multiple hosts, each will try to access the given path
instead of transferring the texture across the network, which would
defeat memory mapping. The given path must be valid on every host
participating in the render. mental ray also supports non-local
mapped textures, so that it is mapped on the master but fetched
across the network by slaves if the <tt>local</tt> keyword is not
supplied, which simplifies scene distribution but may incur
unacceptable network overheads.</li>
<li>The texture should not be on an network-mounted file system
(one that is imported across the network from another host).
Although this simplifies the requirement that the texture must
exist on all hosts, the necessary network transfer performed by the
operating system may reduce the effectiveness and can easily make
memory-mapping slower than regular textures.</li>
<li>Memory-mapping works best if there are extremely large textures
containing many tens of megabytes that are sampled infrequently
because then most of the large texture file is never loaded into
memory.</li>
<li>A memory-mapped file texture must be created on a host with the
same byte order as the host where it will be used. mental ray will
not memory-map textures with an incompatible byte order, and read
the whole texture into memory and convert it instead. This is not
efficient and should be avoided.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the textures and the scene are so large that they do not fit
into physical memory, loading a texture is equivalent to loading
the file into memory, decompressing it, and copying it out to swap.
(The swap is a disk partition that acts as a low-speed extension of
the physical memory that exists as RAM chips in the computer.)
<a id="INDEX38"></a>From then on, accessing a
texture means accessing the swap. Memory mapping eliminates the
read-decompress-write step and accesses the texture from the file
system instead of from swap. This has the side effect that less
swap space is needed. If the texture and scene are not large and
fit into memory, and if the texture is accessed frequently,
memory-mapped textures are slightly slower than regular textures
because the swap would not have been used, but for textures that
are larger than perhaps a hundred kilobytes (uncompressed), memory
mapping is a much more efficient way of loading textures.</p>
<p>This is especially important for mental ray which manages memory
as a cache. Large non-memory mapped textures are a big drain on the
cache because they tend to take up large portions of cache memory.
mental ray has a separate virtual cache manager that loads and
unloads memory-mapped textures efficiently without blocking the
regular cache.</p>
<p class="note"><b>Note:</b> memory-mapping of large concrete
textures is reducing the available adressable memory for mental
ray. This may result in memory faults on 32bit systems with limited
address space. In those cases it is recommended to utilize
<a href="texcache.html">texture caching</a> instead of memory mapping to
optimize texture file access and memory usage.</p>
