<h2 id="fo:ibl">Image-Based Lighting <span class="recent">3.7</span></h2>
<p>
<dfn>Image-based lighting</dfn>, often abbreviated as <dfn>IBL</dfn>,
is a common approach to illuminate a scene by a high-dynamic range image
taken from a real-world environment. Such an image is able to capture and
transport the original light energy and colors from the physical world to the
renderer.
mental ray provides a <dfn>native IBL</dfn> solution for image-based lighting
or lighting from procedurally generated environment. It delivers results with
superior quality and optimized performance compared to traditional ways, like
using <a href="node52.html#fo:finalgather">final gathering</a> combined with
explicitly modeled geometry surrounding the scene with the IBL image mapped
onto its surface.
<p>
Once enabled, and a regular environment shader is attached to the render
camera, mental ray will create an internal special light source which returns
the illumination from the environment. For rendering, mental ray is
pre-sampling the environment and creating lookup acceleration data structures
to support importance-driven adaptive sampling during the lighting
computations in shaders. This light contribution is automatically added to
all shaders performing regular direct light sampling, thus allowing existing
shaders to benefit from this feature.
<p id="fo:ibl_progressive">
The <i>IBL</i> mode can be used in conjunction with progressive rendering.
<p id="fo:ibl_progressive_cache"><span class="new">3.8</span>
For interactive use cases, mental ray provides optimization features which
allow to generate "convincing", but not necessarily physically accurate, results
much faster. The <dfn id="ibl_approximate">approximate IBL</dfn> lighting mode
can be used to trade speed for quality. This feature may be coupled with the
<dfn id="occlusion_cache">occlusion cache</dfn> which stores pre-computed
occlusion information for the geometry in the scene. This data can be used
during rendering to approximate shadowing and render more quickly by avoiding
actual shadow tracing. These technique allow to produces images with much less
noise at the cost of pre-processing time and visible artifacts. Optionally,
the exact IBL solution can be blended in over time, fading out the
interpolation errors and finally converging to the exact solution.
Existing shaders don't need to be adjusted to take benefit of these
optimization features.

<i>IBL</i> can be controlled with <a href="node76.html#opt:ibl">scene options</a>.
