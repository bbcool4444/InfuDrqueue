<h2 id="fo:framebuffers">Frame Buffers</h2>

<p><a id="INDEX75"></a>mental ray stores finally
rendered pixel data in frame buffers. There are up to five main
frame buffers pre-defined in mental ray: for RGBA color, depth,
<a href="node83.html#INDEX289">normal vector</a>s, <a href=
"node32.html#INDEX62">motion vector</a>s, and <b><a name="INDEX76"
id="INDEX76"></a>label</b>s. The depth, normal vector, motion
vector, and label frame buffers store the respective values of
the frontmost object at each sample of the image. If multiple
samples are taken for a pixel, the frame buffer value for that
pixel may be either any one sample value, or a blend of all samples.
The number and type of frame buffers to be rendered is controlled by
<code class="mi">framebuffer</code> statements.
Any number of additional user frame buffers of any data type but identical
resolution to the main frame buffers may be defined. These buffers will not
be filled by mental ray; their content is controlled by custom shaders only,
like <a href="node126.html#SECTION124">output shaders</a>. However,
mental ray will take care of writing the buffer content to image files.
<p>
The <a href="node77.html#mi:framebuffer">framebuffer statement</a> allows to
create 'named' frame buffers in mental ray, together with data type and other
properties for this specific buffer. The number of frame buffers is not
limited by mental ray but only dependent on available system resources.
Storing a frame buffer to an <a href="node38.html#outfiles">output file</a>
can be activated per buffer. It is possible to store several frame buffers
in a single file with multiple channels, for capable formats like
<a href="node19.html#INDEX29">OpenEXR</a>. mental ray will take care of
performing all required operations like data conversions and compression.
For backwards compatibility, frame buffer creation may also be controlled
with <a href="node77.html#INDEX227">output statement</a>s.</p>
<p>
The primary purpose of <a href="node77.html#mi:output">output statement</a>s
is to specify <a href="node126.html#INDEX492">output shader</a>s which
operate on the frame buffers. For backwards compatibility, deprecated
<a href="node77.html#mi:fileoutput">output statement</a>s can also specify files
to write.</p>

<a id="INDEX77"></a>
<h3 id="fo:framebuffer_files">Frame Buffer Files</h3>

<p>mental ray is able to temporarily store <a href="node144.html#INDEX617">frame
buffer</a>s in <b>frame buffer file</b>s on disk
instead of keeping them in memory during rendering, given that sufficient disk
space is available. This allows to use very large frame buffers, or very large
numbers of frame buffers, without being limited by available physical memory.
This feature can be controlled on the mental ray
<a href="node245.html#cli:framebuffer">command line</a>.
By default, this disk cache mechanism is using memory mapping techniques for
performance reasons, which requires that the frame buffers fully fit into the
virtual memory address space of the process.</p>
<p>
The <a id="fo:framebuffer_cache"></a><b>frame buffer cache</b>, on the other hand,
stores only fragments of frame buffers in the disk files on demand. This feature
may save significant amount of memory when rendering very high resolution images,
and is especially useful on 32bit systems with limited memory resources. If enabled,
only a small fraction of each frame buffer is present in memory, like the currently
rendered tile, and tiles recently accessed in mental ray by the display callbacks,
output shaders, or when writing final images to files. This technique is typically
superior to memory mapped frame buffers which need to be stored and restored as a
whole, hence more appropriate when rendering many but smaller frame buffers.
</p>
<p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Memory mapping large files can occupy
a significant portion of the application's virtual address space.
The address space for a single process is limited on 32-bit
architectures to 4 gigabytes or less, dependent on reserved space
for system frameworks and libraries. Trying to map a very large
file or many files might fail since there is not enough room left
for the process to address it.</p>
<p>Frame buffer files are stored in the directory specified with the
<tt>-fb_dir</tt><a href="node245.html#cli:framebuffer">command line option</a>;
or in the directory specified in the <tt>TMPDIR</tt> or <tt>TEMP</tt>
<a href="configuration.html#INDEX1085">environment variable</a>s.
<p>Frame buffer files are removed from disk when rendering has finished.</p>
