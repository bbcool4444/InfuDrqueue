<h3>Speed vs. Quality Tradeoffs</h3>
<p>

<p>
Since these graphs consist of distinct nodes that communicate
only by frame buffers, it is possible to switch nodes between
hardware and software. This has several applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Switching by shader</b>: whenever a hardware variant of a
shader is available, use it, even if it has reduced functionality.
This is useful for fast previews. For example, while the user
interacts with the scene by moving an object, fast preview
rendering is done; when the interactions stops a high-quality image
is rendered and displayed.</li>
<li><b>Switching by layer</b>: speed can be further accelerated by
marking layers as optional, for example rendering only the base
surface without the more expensive Phong highlight layer.</li>
<li><b>Switching by functionality</b>: specific effects can be
achieved by switching functional node groups between hardware and
software rendering. For example, an object may be rendered in
software with accurate transparent ray-traced shadows, or it may be
rendered in hardware with nontransparent shadowmapped shadows. In
general, any effect that requires surface mapping can be switched
in this way by rendering the map in software and the mapped object
in hardware.</li>
<li><b>Switching by object</b>: entire objects and all their
associated shaders can be switched. This is useful for scenes that
are well suited for hardware rendering, except for a small number
of objects that require the flexibility of software.</li>
<li><b>Layer Persistence</b>: recomputation of software layers can
be delayed for some frames. It is often sufficient to re-use light
maps for multiple frames. Not every node in the graph needs to be
executed for every frame.</li>
</ul>
<p>These modes are a central design goal because they provide a
smooth continuous tradeoff between speed and quality.
Traditionally, hardware rendering was considered to generate images
with poor quality, good enough for fast games but not for
professional video or film production. But in fact not all aspects
of a scene have equally high demands on rendering complexity - some
parts of a scene can easily be rendered in hardware, while others
absolutely require software. mental ray 3.3 is designed to permit
this arbitrary combination of hardware and software rendering.</p>
