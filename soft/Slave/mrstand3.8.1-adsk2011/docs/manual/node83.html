<h3>Objects</h3>

<p><a id="INDEX268"></a>
All <b><a id="INDEX269"></a>geometry</b> is typically specified in
<b><a id="INDEX270"></a>object space</b>.
In <a href="node101.html#INDEX369">object space</a> mode, enabled with a setting
in the <a href="node76.html#INDEX0">options</a> block, the camera location is
determined by its <a href="node90.html#INDEX339">instance</a>, all objects are
defined in local <b><a id="INDEX271"></a>object coordinate</b>s and positioned
in the scene with their object <a href="node90.html#INDEX339">instance</a>s.
Every object, camera, or light requires an instance to be established in the
scene for rendering.</p>
<p><span class="depr">Deprecated</span>
In camera space mode, the <a href="node77.html#INDEX226">camera</a> is fixed and
assumed to sit at the coordinate origin and point down the negative Z axis, all
objects are defined using camera space coordinates. Camera space mode is supported
only for backwards compatibility, and is not recommended.</p>

<p>The appearance of the object, such as color and transparency, is
determined by naming materials in the object definition. Before a
<a href="node79.html#INDEX242">material</a> can be used in an
object, it must be defined. Naming the material determines all
aspects of the object's appearance. No further parameters,
textures, or lights need to be specified; they are all part of the
material definition.</p>
<p>The two most common approaches to materials and objects are to
name all materials first and then all objects, which may simplify
the implementation of material editors because all materials may be
put in a separate file and then included in the <tt>.mi</tt> file
using a <tt>$include</tt> command; or materials and objects may be
interspersed. Either way, each material definition precedes its
first use.</p>
<p>All polygonal and free-form surface objects have the same common
format in the <tt>.mi</tt> file:</p>

            <i>approximation list</i>
        end group
    end object
</pre>
<p>The individual parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <tt><a href="node83.html#INDEX268">object</a></tt> name
<i>object_name</i> serves to uniquely identify the object. The name
is not used by mental ray in any form except to give meaningful
progress reports and error messages. Object names should be
enclosed in double quotes to disambiguate them from reserved
words.</li>

<li>The <tt>visible</tt> flag<a id="INDEX272"></a>
causes the object to be visible. Most objects will have this flag set.
Not setting it, or setting it to <code>off</code> will make the object
invisible to <a href="node124.html#INDEX489">primary ray</a>s (those
originating from the <a href="node77.html#INDEX226">camera</a>), which
means it will disappear from the image. The optional boolean argument
defaults to <tt>on</tt>. If no <tt>trace</tt> statement is present, it
defaults to <tt>off</tt> (this is also true for all other boolean
flags).</li>

<li class="note" style="list-style-type:none">
Note, that <a href="node76.html#INDEX199">transparency ray</a>s will
also hit objects marked <tt>visible</tt>. In this case, transparency
is not considered a special case of refraction, but as a scanline
rendering feature. This apparent inconsistency permits using
transparency effects even if <a href="node102.html#INDEX390">ray
tracing</a> is turned off altogether. More importantly, it also keeps
objects that have the <tt>visible</tt> flag but not the <tt>trace</tt>
flag out of the BSP tree that is used to accelerate ray tracing, which
has a significant performance impact. This tradeoff can become very
significant for large scenes.</li>

<li>The <tt>shadow</tt> flag<a id="INDEX273"></a>
causes the object to cast <a href="node76.html#INDEX197">shadow</a>s.
The standard case is
specifying both the <tt>visible</tt> and <tt>shadow</tt> flags. If an
object is very complex, it may be desirable to set only the
<tt>visible</tt> flag but not the <tt>shadow</tt> flag, and create
a second object that resembles the first one but is much simpler
and set the <tt>shadow</tt> but not the <tt>visible</tt> flag on
it. The effect is that the object appears unchanged, but shadow
calculations see a much simpler shadow object that casts approximately the
same shadow as the primary visible object would. Shadows are globally
disabled if the scene <a href="node76.html#INDEX180">options block</a>
specifies <tt>shadow off</tt>.</li>

<li style="list-style-type:none">
The <tt>shadow</tt> <var>mode</var> allows to control shadowing details
of the object. It specifies whether the object casts shadows (<tt>1</tt>),
receives shadows (<tt>2</tt>), does both (<tt>3</tt>), or has no impact
on any shadows (<code>0</code>). The default is <tt>2</tt>.</li>

<li>The <tt>shadowmap</tt> flag<a id="INDEX274"></a> controls whether
an object can cast a shadowmap. The default is <tt>on</tt>. For an object to
cast shadowmap shadows, the shadow <var>mode</var> must have casting enabled
as well. This flag is useful for transparent volume bounding objects called
<span id="INDEX275"><b>hull objects</b></span>, such as visible light cones,
that are fully transparent but should not cast shadows.</li>

<li>The <tt>trace</tt> flag<a id="INDEX276"></a> serves a similar purpose as
the <tt>shadow</tt> flag. Normally, it is always set along with the
<tt>visible</tt> and <tt>shadow</tt> flags. It controls whether the object is
visible to secondary (reflected or refracted) rays. If the reflecting or
refracting objects are fuzzy or only slightly reflective or refractive,
it may result in a considerable speedup to make the
<a href="node142.html#INDEX581">reflection</a> and
<a href="node115.html#INDEX446">refraction</a> rays see a much simpler object
than primary rays would. Like with the <tt>shadow</tt> flag, this is achieved
by not setting the <tt>trace</tt> flag in the primary, high-definition object,
and create a second one that roughly resembles the primary object that has the
<tt>trace</tt> flag (and perhaps the <tt>shadow</tt> flag) but not the
<tt>visible</tt> flag set. Ray tracing is globally disabled if the scene
<a href="node76.html#INDEX180">options block</a> specifies <tt>trace off</tt>.
</li>

<li>The <tt>reflection</tt> <var>mode</var><a id="INDEX277"></a>
controls if an object is visible in reflections on other objects, and if it
shows reflections of other objects: <code>1</code> enables reflection casting,
<code>2</code> enables reflection receiving, <code>3</code> enables both, and
<code>0</code> disables both. Default is <i>mode</i> <code>2</code>.</li>

<li class="note" style="list-style-type:none" id="mi:objectmode">
Note, that <em>casting reflections</em> has an opposite meaning to <em>casting
reflection rays</em>: in order to <em>cast reflections</em> or <em>become
visible in reflections on other objects</em> an object must <em>receive
reflection rays</em>, and to <em>receive reflections</em> or <em>show
reflections of other objects</em> an object has to <em>cast reflection
rays</em>. The <var>mode</var> controls casting and receiving the <em>shading
effect</em>, like in <em>casting shadows</em>.</li>

<li>The <tt>refraction</tt> <var>mode</var><a id="INDEX278"></a>
controls if an object is visible in refractions on other objects, and if it
shows other objects in refractions: <code>1</code> enables refraction casting,
<code>2</code> enables refraction receiving, <code>3</code> enables both, and
<code>0</code> disables both. Default is <i>mode</i> <code>2</code>. Note,
that <em>casting</em> means <em>casting a refraction</em>, which is the
opposite to <em>casting a refraction ray</em>. See
<a href="#mi:objectmode">reflection mode notice</a> for details.</li>

<li>The <tt>transparency</tt> <var>mode</var><a id="INDEX279"></a>
controls if an object is visible in transparent parts of other objects, and
if it shows other objects in transparent parts: <code>1</code> enables
transparency casting, <code>2</code> enables transparency receiving,
<code>3</code> enables both, and <code>0</code> disabled both. Default is
<i>mode</i> <code>3</code>. See <a href="#INDEX278">refraction mode</a> for
details.</li>

<li>The <tt>select</tt> flag makes the object subject to select-tracing.
This feature is used by some applications to perform interactive object
picking by sending a ray into the scene (perhaps where a user point-clicked
the mouse) and receiving a list of objects visited by the ray. Only objects
with the <tt>select</tt> flag will appear in this list.</li>

<li><a id="mi:tagged"></a>
The <tt>tagged</tt> flag<a id="INDEX280"></a>
changes the way geometry is stored. Normally, every polygon, surface, and
triangle comes with its own optional material. If an object specifies no
materials, the material is inherited from the instance. Objects
marked <tt>tagged</tt> do not store materials at all and always
rely on the inherited instance material, and permit specifying a
non-optional label integer in place of the material in polygon and
surface definitions. (Non-optional means that a tagged object
<i>must</i> contain one label integer for every polygon and
surface.) This label can be accessed by shaders during rendering
(not in output shaders) using the <tt>miQ_GEO_LABEL</tt>
<i><a href="miquery.html#api:mi_query">query</a></i>.
The idea is that a shared material distinguishes parts of the object by label
integer, instead of attaching a different material to each polygon or surface.
</li>

<li>The <tt>caustic on</tt> flag
lets the object participate in optimized generation of caustics. A caustic is
an illumination effect caused by light that undergoes specular reflections or
refractions before it hits a diffuse object. For example, a water surface
which casts irregular light patterns on the floor of a swimming pool.
To simulate this effect, the light source must emit <tt>caustic photon</tt>s
and contain appropriate photon energy settings, and the
<a href="node115.html#INDEX440">material shader</a> of the floor object needs
to pick up caustic light information. For optimized caustic generation, the
rendering options should specify <code>caustic 0</code> and the water surface
and floor objects must have the <tt>caustic</tt> flag set. Setting this flag
to <tt>off</tt> means that the object is hidden from caustics alltogether.
Caustics can be globally disabled in the render
<a href="node76.html#INDEX180">options</a> with <tt>caustic off</tt>.</li>

<li style="list-style-type:none">
The <tt>caustic</tt> <i>mode</i> controls the interaction of caustics with the
object:
<code>1</code> enables caustic casting, <code>2</code> enables caustic receiving,
<code>3</code> enables both, and <code>0</code> disables both. In the pool
example, the water surface should have <i>mode</i> <code>1</code> and the
floor should have <i>mode</i> <code>2</code>. If the <tt>caustic</tt> keyword
is given without <i>mode</i> argument it defaults to <code>3</code>. If no
<tt>caustic</tt> keyword is given the <i>mode</i> defaults to <code>0</code>.
</li>

<li>The <tt>globillum on</tt> flag
lets the object participate in optimized generation of global illumination.
Global illumination is a lighting effect caused by diffuse interreflection,
such as a red table bleeding<a id="INDEX281"></a> red color onto an adjacent
white wall. To simulate this effect, the
<a href="node115.html#INDEX440">material</a> of both the table and the wall
must provide <a href="node142.html#INDEX580">photon shader</a>s, the light
source must emit <tt>globillum photon</tt>s and contain appropriate photon
energy settings, and the <a href="node115.html#INDEX440">material shader</a>
of the wall must pick up global illumination light information.
For optimized global illumination simulation, the render options should
specify <code>globillum 0</code> and the red table and white wall must have
the <tt>globillum</tt> flag set. Setting the flag to <tt>off</tt> means that
the object is hidden to global illumination
<a href="node142.html#INDEX579">photon</a>s, and <tt>on</tt> (the default)
enables global illumination interactions with this object. Global illumination
can be globally disabled in the render <a href="node76.html#INDEX180">options</a>
with <tt>globillum off</tt>.</li>

<li style="list-style-type:none">
The <tt>globillum</tt> <i>mode</i> controls the
<a href="node48.html#INDEX95">global illumination</a> interaction with the
object:
<code>1</code> enables global illumination casting,
<code>2</code> enables global illumination receiving,
<code>3</code> enables both, and <code>0</code> disables both.
The default <var>mode</var> can be specified in the
<a href="node76.html#INDEX0">options</a>.In the table example, the red table
should have (at least) <i>mode</i> <code>1</code> and the white wall should
have (at least) <i>mode</i> <code>2</code>. If the <tt>globillum</tt> keyword is
given without <i>mode</i> argument, the <i>mode</i> defaults to <code>3</code>.
</li>
<li class="note"style="list-style-type:none">
If an object is very complex it may be desirable to set only the <tt>visible</tt>
flag but not the <tt>globillum</tt> flag, and create a second object with
simplified geometry that resembles the first one with the <tt>globillum</tt>
but not the <tt>visible</tt> flag set. The effect is that the rendered object
appears in full detail but simulation of global illumination is faster since a
simpler object representation is used.</li>

<li>The <tt>finalgather on<dfn>|</dfn>off</tt> and
<tt>finalgather</tt> <i>mode</i> control final gathering for this object.
If set to <tt>off</tt> means that the object is hidden to final gather rays,
and <tt>on</tt>, the default, enables final gathering illumination interactions
with this object. The <i>mode</i> <code>1</code> enables final gather
illumination casting. If the bit is not set but <i>finalgather on</i> is given
then finalgather ray would be terminated by the object and return black color.
The <var>mode</var> <code>2</code> enables final gather illumination receiving,
<code>3</code> enables both, and <code>0</code> disables both. Default is
<i>mode</i> <code>0</code>.</li>

<li>The <tt>finalgather file</tt> <i>file (list)</i>
argument allows to specify a file name or a list of file names with
finalgather map(s) to be used for the object. If identical file
names or file name lists are used for several objects, only one
copy of finalgather map will be kept in memory.</li>

<li>The <tt>face</tt> flag
controls face culling for the object.
<a id="INDEX282"></a> The possible values are <tt>'f'</tt> for <dfn>front</dfn>,
<tt>'b'</tt> for <dfn>back</dfn>, and <tt>'a'</tt> for <dfn>both</dfn> (all).
If not specified, the culling flag default of the options or the override in
the shader state will be used.</li>

<li>The <tt>box</tt> statement specifies a bounding box for the object,
in the space of the object. For polygons, this is easy to compute: the box
components are simply the smallest ( <i>min</i>) and largest ( <i>max</i>)
point-in-space ( <tt>v</tt>) vector components. For free-form surfaces,
the box can in principle be derived in the same way; however, such a box
would often be much too large, especially for NURBS. Boxes that are too large
are legal but inefficient. If the box statement is omitted, mental ray will
compute one from all vertices, which is also not very efficient. Boxes are
required if the object is demand-loaded. The box should not include
enlargement caused by displacement or motion.</li>

<li>The <tt>motion box</tt> is similar to the box, but contains the
minimum and maximum components of all
<a href="node32.html#INDEX62">motion vector</a>s. Note that this is not the
same as the smallest and largest vector; the motion box vectors are
pieced together from the individual smallest and largest motion
vector <i>components</i>. A motion box must be specified if the
object has both a box and motion vectors.</li>

<li><a id="maxdisplace"></a><a id="INDEX283"></a>
The <tt>max displace</tt> statement
specifies the maximum displacement applied to object control points in
local object space in normal direction. If a displacement shader returns
a value grater than <i>value</i>, the rendered geometry may appear clipped
and a warning is printed. Displaced objects should always specify a
maximum displacement. The default is 0. Without <tt>max displace</tt>
mental ray will truncate any displacement to 0.0, actually disabling
displacement.

<li class="note" style="list-style-type:none">
A <code>max displace</code> value that is too large generates correct images
but puts more pressure on memory and performance, since larger areas of an
object may be displaced, thus creating much more triangles in longer time.
In particular, mental ray may suffer serious performance losses, even by an
order of magnitude, if the displaced object uses <i>fine</i> approximations.
If the <code>max displace</code> value is too small, mental ray will limit
the absolute displacement to the <code>max displace</code> value.</li>

<li>The <tt>ray offset</tt> allows to enforce an offset for the origin of
secondary rays cast from the geometry, in world space units. When a ray is
traced, any intersections which are closer to the emanating surface than the
given offset <em>value</em> are ignored. This can be useful to avoid
self-intersections, especially in situations where multiple, slightly
different, tessellations of the same geometry are used, like rasterized
triangles for primary visible rendering and approximate tessellations for
ray tracing.</li>

<li>The <tt>samples</tt>
statement controls per-object <b><a id="INDEX284"></a>oversampling</b>.
For all pixels that touch this object, the normal samples range specified
in the <a href="node76.html#INDEX180">options block</a> is constrained to
the <i>min</i> <i>max</i> range, such that at least
<span class="math">2<sup>min</sup></span> and at most
<span class="math">2<sup>max</sup></span> samples are taken. Constraints
that exceed the <i>min</i> and <i>max</i> limits in the render
<a href="node76.html#INDEX180">options block</a> are ignored, so that the
options can be used to force quick preview rendering without having to
change all object sampling specifiers. If the pixel touches multiple
objects, perhaps due to reflection or refraction, the highest <i>min</i>
and the highest <i>max</i> are used. If the pixel touches no objects at all,
the default limits <i>defmin</i> and <i>defmax</i> defined in the
<a href="node76.html#INDEX180">options</a> are used. The defaults are
-128 127, which disables per-object sampling limits. Note that this setting
is not used by the rasterizer.</li>

<li>The <tt>shading samples</tt>
controls per-object sampling for the
<i><a href="node34.html">rasterizer</a></i>. This will locally override the
global setting in the render <a href="node76.html#INDEX180">options</a>.
It is also possible to specify this setting per-instance, if needed, but the
instance setting will override the object setting, when both are present.
Typically, this is used to keep the global scene default low for performance
reasons, but boost the setting for selected objects or instances only, to
achieve the desired quality in the final rendering.
</li>

<li>The <tt>tag</tt>
assigns a <var>label</var> number to the object for identification. The number
is an arbitrary 32-bit integer value. The term <i>label</i> is normally used
in mental ray for this identifier, the keyword <tt>tag</tt> is retained for
backwards compatibility (a <i>tag</i> is used in shaders to identify entries
in the scene database). With an appropriate <tt>output</tt> or
<tt>framebuffer</tt> statement in the
<var><a href="node77.html#INDEX226">camera</a></var> it is possible to let
mental ray write a label file that, for each pixel, contains the label code
of the object that the camera ray hits first. Exactly which label is stored
is under control of the material shader; using the label of the foremost object
regardless of reflections and refractions is merely the default behavior.
</li>

<li>The <tt>data</tt>
statement attaches <b><a id="INDEX285"></a>user data</b> to the object.
The argument must be the name of a previously defined data element in the scene
file. If <tt>null</tt> is specified instead of a data element name, a previously
existing data reference is removed.</li>

<li id="mi:object_file"><a id="mi:placeholder"></a>
The <tt>file</tt> statement can be used to load the final object from a
separate file when mental ray hits the bounding box of the object, also
known as a <b>placeholder</b> object. The <dfn>placeholder</dfn> object
needs to specify a valid <tt>box</tt>, optionally a <tt>motion box</tt> if
the object has <a href="node32.html#INDEX62">motion vector</a>s, and a
<tt>max displace</tt> setting if the object is displaced. The actual geometry
in the <tt>group ... end group</tt> block can be omitted. The specified file
must contain an exact copy of the object, except that the <tt>file</tt>
statement is replaced with the <tt>group ... end group</tt> block and the
<tt>incremental</tt> keyword is specified for the <tt>object</tt>. The
object may have only a single <a href="node83.html#mi:group">object group</a>.
Demand-loaded objects are useful to avoid parsing and permanently storing
large objects that may or may not be required for rendering.
The <code style="white-space:nowrap">-echo explode</code> command-line option
can be used to automatically create demand-loaded object files.</li>

<li>The <i>basis list</i> is a list of bases to be used in
<a href="node9.html#INDEX13">free-form surface</a> descriptions. Only
<a href="node85.html#INDEX0">curve</a>s and surfaces use bases. For
a list of supported bases, see section <a href="node85.html#basis">basis</a>.
The defined bases can be used in all
groups that follow, until the end of the object.</li>

<li>The <code>group</code>
contains the actual geometric representation. Multiple object groups are
supported for backwards compatibility but deprecated; mental ray will
automatically convert a multi-group object to an instance group containing
multiple sub-objects. See <a href="#mi:group">object group</a> for details.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The <tt>visible</tt>, <tt>shadow</tt>, <tt>trace</tt>, <tt>reflection</tt>,
<tt>refraction</tt>, <tt>transparency</tt>, <tt>caustic</tt>,
<tt>globillum</tt>, <tt>finalgather</tt> and <tt>face</tt> flags can be
overridden by the instance using the standard
<a href="node90.html#INDEX348">inheritance</a> mechanism. Instances can
specify that a flag in the instanced object is turned on or off, or that
it is left unchanged. The object flags are used only if all the instances
from the root of the <b><a id="INDEX286"></a>scene DAG</b> down to the
object all leave the flag unchanged.</p>

<h4 id="mi:group">Object Group</h4>
<p>
Object groups contain the actual <b>geometry</b>. Common to all geometry
are <i>vector list</i>s and <i>vertex list</i>s.</p>

<h5 id="mi:vectors">Vector List</h5>
<p>
The <i>vector list</i> contains 3D <a href="node83.html#INDEX0">vector</a>s
which describe points in space, normals, texture vertices, basis vectors,
motion vectors, and others. Vectors are anonymous, they are triples of
floating-point numbers separated by <a href="node60.html#INDEX112">whitespace</a>
without inherent meaning. They are numbered beginning with 0. Numbering restarts
at 0 whenever a new <a href="node83.html#mi:group">object group</a> starts.</p>

<p>mental ray also accepts a compressed binary
<a id="INDEX287"></a> format for vectors. Instead of three floating-point
numbers, a sequence of 12 bytes enclosed in backquotes is accepted.
These 12 bytes are the memory image of three floats in IEEE 854 format,
using big-endian byte order. This format is intended to increase translation
and parsing speed when ray is connected to a native translator; it should not
be used in files to be modified with text editors or filters, since they may
refuse to accept files containing binary data, or corrupt them.</p>

<h5 id="mi:vertices">Vertex List</h5>

<p>Vertices<a id="INDEX288"></a> build on vectors.
In the <tt>.mi</tt> format, there is no syntactical difference between polygon
vertices and control points vertices for free-form surfaces; both are
collectively referred to as <var>vertices</var> in this discussion. All
vertices define a point in space and optional vertex normals, motion vectors,
derivatives, zero or more textures and basis vectors, and optional
<a href="node83.html#INDEX294">user vector</a>s:
</p>
<pre>
    v <i>index</i><sub>int</sub>  
    <dfn>[</dfn> n <i>index</i><sub>int</sub> <dfn>]</dfn>  
    <dfn>[</dfn> d <i>index</i><sub>int</sub> <i>index</i><sub>int</sub> <dfn>[</dfn> <i>index</i><sub>int</sub> <dfn>[</dfn> <i>index</i><sub>int</sub> <i>index</i><sub>int</sub> <dfn>] ] ]</dfn>  
    <dfn>[</dfn> t <i>index</i><sub>int</sub> <dfn>[</dfn> <i>index</i><sub>int</sub> <i>index</i><sub>int</sub> <dfn>] ]</dfn>  
    <dfn>[</dfn> m <i>index</i><sub>int</sub> <dfn>]</dfn>  
    <dfn>[</dfn> u <i>index</i><sub>int</sub>  
    ...  
</pre>
<p>Polygon vertices may use all of these. Free-form surface control
points may use <tt>v</tt> and <tt>m</tt> only; the others are
either computed analytically or are specified in other ways as part
of the surface definition.</p>
<dl>
<dt><tt>v</tt></dt>
<dd>specifies the point in space,</dd>

<dt><tt>n</tt></dt>
<dd>specifies the <a href="node83.html#INDEX288">vertex</a>
<b><a id="INDEX289"></a>normal vector</b> (ignored when the vertex is used
as a curve or surface <a href="node85.html#INDEX311">control point</a>).
A normal vector defines the orientation (vertical) of the surface at this
vertex.</dd>

<dt><tt>m</tt></dt>
<dd>specifies the <a href="node32.html#INDEX62">motion vector</a>.
mental ray permits up to 15 <tt>m</tt> statements per <tt>v</tt> statement
for nonlinear <b><a id="INDEX290"></a>motion path</b>s. If multiple motion
vectors are specified, the shutter time interval 0..1 is equally subdivided,
and each motion vector specifies the motion from the origin specified by
the <tt>v</tt> vector to the corresponding point on the path. In other words,
multiple motion vectors do not form a connected chain but a bundle of "rays"
originating at the same point <tt>v</tt>.</dd>

<dt><tt>t</tt></dt>
<dd>specifies a <b><a id="INDEX291"></a>texture vertex</b>
<a id="INDEX292"></a> with an optional X/Y <b><a id="INDEX293"></a>basis
vector</b> pair for <a href="node21.html#INDEX39">bump map</a> calculation.
There can be up to 64 <tt>t</tt> lines for any given <tt>v</tt> vertex.
The texture and basis vectors are ignored when the vertex is used as a curve
or surface control point. Texture and basis information for surfaces is defined
using a "texture surface", described below.</dd>

<dt><tt>d</tt></dt>
<dd>specifies a first and/or second <a href="node88.html#INDEX333">surface
derivative</a>. First derivatives describe the UV parametric gradient of a
surface; second derivatives describe the curvature. mental ray can compute
surface derivatives analytically for free-form surfaces but not for polygons
because polygons have no inherent UV coordinate space. Therefore, the
<tt>d</tt> keyword must be used to define explicit surface derivatives for
polygons. If <tt>d</tt> is followed by two indices they are taken to reference
the first derivative <i>d P du</i> and <i>d P dv</i> (with P being the point
in space); if three indices follow they are taken to reference the second
derivative <i>d^2 P du^2</i>, <i>d^2 P dv^2</i>, and <i>d^2 P du dv</i>;
and if five indices follow the first two describe the first derivatives and
the next three the second derivatives. Derivatives are not used by mental ray,
they are made available to shaders only.</dd>

<dt><tt>u</tt></dt>
<dd>specifies a <b><a id="INDEX294"></a>user vector</b>. No constraints are
imposed on user vectors. mental ray does not operate on them in any way,
they are passed through with the vertex and can be picked up by the shader.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Every vertex begins with a <tt>v</tt> statement and ends with
the next <tt>v</tt> statement or with the start of the geometry
description. All occurrences of <i>index</i> above reference the
vector list; 0 is the first vector in this group. References of
different types (for example, <tt>v</tt> and <tt>n</tt>) may not
reference the same vector. As stated before, all vectors are 3D. If
the third coordinate is not used (as is the case for 2D texture
vertices, for 2D curve control points, and for 2D surface special
points) it should be set to 0.0 by convention. If both the second
and third coordinates are unused (as is the case for 1D curve
special points), they should both be set to 0.0.</p>
<p>Vertices themselves are numbered independently of vectors. The
first vertex in every group is numbered 0. The geometry description
is referencing vertices by <b><a id="INDEX295"></a>vertex index</b>,
just like vertices are referencing vectors by <b><a id="INDEX296"></a>vector
index</b>. This results in a three-stage definition of geometry:</p>
<ol>
<li>List of vectors</li>
<li>List of vertices</li>
<li>List of geometry</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason for this three-stage process is that it allows both sharing
vectors and sharing vertices. This is best illustrated with the following
examples.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>
The examples will use the simplest form of <b><a id="INDEX297"></a>polygon</b>
syntax that will be described later in this section.</p>
<p>
Consider two triangles ABC and ABD sharing an edge AB.
The simplest definition of this two-triangle
object is:</p>
<pre>
    object "twotri"
        visible
        group
            0.0  0.0  0.0
            1.0  0.0  0.0
            0.0  1.0  0.0
            1.0  0.0  0.0
            1.0  1.0  0.0
            0.0  1.0  0.0
     
            v 0
            v 1
            v 2
            v 3
            v 4
            v 5
     
            p "material_name" 0 1 2
            p 3 4 5
        end group
    end object
</pre>
<p>The first three vectors are used to build the first three
vertices, which are used in the first triangle. The remaining three
vectors build the next three vertices, which are used for the
second triangle. Two vectors are listed twice and can be shared:</p>
<pre>
    object "twotri"
        visible
        group
            0.0  0.0  0.0
            1.0  0.0  0.0
            0.0  1.0  0.0
            1.0  1.0  0.0
     
            v 0
            v 1
            v 2
            v 1
            v 3
            v 2
     
            p "material_name" 0 1 2
            p 3 4 5
        end group
    end object
</pre>
<p>The order of vector references is noncontiguous to ensure that
the second triangle is in counter-clockwise order. Two vertices are
redundant and can also be removed by sharing:</p>
<pre>
    object "twotri"
        visible
        group
            0.0  0.0  0.0
            1.0  0.0  0.0
            0.0  1.0  0.0
            1.0  1.0  0.0
     
            v 0
            v 1
            v 2
            v 3
     
            p "material_name" 0 1 2
            p 1 3 2
        end group
    end object
</pre>
<p>The need for sharing both vectors and vertices can be shown by
specifying vertex normals:</p>
<pre>
    object "twotri"
        visible
        group
            0.0  0.0  0.0
            1.0  0.0  0.0
            0.0  1.0  0.0
            1.0  1.0  0.0
            0.0  0.0  1.0
     
            v 0  n 4
            v 1  n 4
            v 2  n 4
            v 3  n 4
     
            p "material_name" 0 1 2
            p 1 3 2
        end group
    end object
</pre>
<p>In this last example, both vector sharing and vertex sharing
takes place. The normal in this example is actually redundant: if
no normal is specified, mental ray uses the <b><a name="INDEX298"
id="INDEX298"></a>polygon normal</b>. Defaulting to the polygon
normal is slightly more efficient than interpolating vertex
normals, if vertex normals are explicitly specified.</p>

<h5 id="mi:geometry">Geometry List</h5>

<p>Various types of geometry can be contained in the <i>geometry list</i>,
like polygonal geometry, triangle lists, free-from and subdivision surfaces.
In the next sections the syntax of these definitions is described in detail.
</p>

<h5 id="mi:approximations">Approximation List</h5>

<p>At the end of each object <code>group</code> several
<a href="node89.html#INDEX334">approximation</a> statements may be given
which control the tessellation of the geometry. In polygonal object groups,
the approximation is used only for polygons whose material contains a
displacement shader. Free-form and subdivision surfaces are always controlled
by their approximations. See <a href="node89.html#approx">approxomations</a>
for details.</p>

<p class="note">An <var>object group</var> permits only one type of
<a href="node83.html#INDEX269">geometry</a>, either polygons or surfaces
but not both. It is recommended that objects contain only a single object
group, so normally objects are either polygonal or surface objects but not
both at the same time. Also, vector sharing is supported only for vectors
of similar types (point in space, normal, motion, texture, basis vector,
derivative, or user vector. A vector may not be referenced by vertices
once as a point in space and once as a normal, for example.</p>
