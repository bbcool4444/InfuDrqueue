<h3>Elliptical Projection Filter Lookup</h3>
<p><a id="INDEX48"></a> This method was implemented
in mental ray in order to provide a very high quality texture
filtering, far superior to the pyramid filtering explained above.
It eliminates most if not all of the aliasing in high texture
frequencies. When using checkerboard textures mapped onto a
rectangle, for example, there is much less blurring at the horizon
where the texture compression is severe. With
<a href="node22.html#INDEX46">mip-map texture</a>s as explained above, the
blurring at such extreme compressions is sometimes still
visible.</p>
<p>The main cause for the excessively blurry-looking images using
mip-maps is the approximation of the pixel projection area by a
square. With elliptical filtering a circle around the current
sampling location is projected to texture space and will give
either a circle or an ellipse as a projection shape. Instead of
approximating this curve by simple shapes like squares, a direct
convolution (averaging) of all texels which are inside the ellipse
area is done. Averaging all texels in this area can take quite
long, so mental ray uses pyramids of prefiltered textures to
accelerate this. There are various parameters explained below which
control modification of ellipse shape and level selection in the
pyramid.</p>
<p>The most difficult part when elliptical projections are used is
that a screen to texture space transformation matrix has to be
provided. This matrix is used in the filtering code to transform
the circle around the current sampling location to texture space.
mental ray provides two helper functions for constructing this
matrix when UV texture coordinates are available; see
<i><a href="node150.html#INDEX745">mi_texture_filter_project</a></i> in the
Writing Shaders chapter. If those are not available and (for
example) direct cylinder projective mappings are used, it is much
easier to calculate this matrix.</p>
<p>The following filtering algorithm is applied: first, a circle in
the current sampling location is transformed to the ellipse using
the provided transformation matrix. Then the eccentricity of the
ellipse is calculated (major radius divided by minor radius). If
the eccentricity is larger than a specified maximum, the minor
radius is adjusted (made larger) to make sure that this
eccentricity maximum always holds. The reason for this enlargement
is that the direct convolution is done in the pyramid level based
on the minor axis length of the ellipse. There is another parameter
which specifies the maximum allowed number of texels the minor
radius may cover. If that number is exceeded in the finest level
(zero), a higher level is used. In the second level, for example,
the minor radius has half the size etc. Enlarging the minor radius
when the eccentricity is exceeded, basically means that we are
going up in the pyramid. So, for very large ellipses, mental ray is
making them "fatter" and uses a higher level in the pyramid.
Referring to the checkerboard-mapped plane example above, the
circle is projected to very large thin ellipses near the horizon,
covering thousands of texels, and using the technique above, mental
ray just makes a few texture lookups in the higher pyramid
levels.</p>
<p>There is another parameter which modifies the size of the circle
to be projected, usually the radius is 0.5, making it larger
introduces more blurring, making it less gives more aliasing.</p>
<p>The projection helper functions expect another parameter which
is the maximum offset of the central sampling location to the two
other points which have to be selected. The other two points should
be inside the pixel, but since mental ray is using the current
intersection primitive (the triangle) also for these points to
determine the UV texture coordinates, a smaller value than 0.5
(pixel corners) is appropriate since mental ray might hit the
triangle plane outside the triangle area. Usually 0.3 gives good
results. When the UV coordinates are calculated using cylinder
projections, it is possible to obtain the UV coordinates much
faster and also much more accurately.</p>
