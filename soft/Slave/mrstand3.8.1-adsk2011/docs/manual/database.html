<h2 id="fo:scene">Scene Database</h2>
<p>
The scene database is the main storage for all scene data that comprise the
model to be rendered, including geometry data, the scene DAG hierarchy, light
and camera information, as well as material properties and its referenced set
of individual shaders and phenomena, and last but not least custom user data.
</p>

<h2 id="fo:geometry">Geometry</h2>
<p>
mental ray supports a wide variety of common geometry descriptions as source
of input, like surface models based on polygons or triangles, freeform surfaces
with trimming curves in several representations, and subdivision surface
geometry in hierarchical or plain base mesh form. mental ray will convert
such surface descriptions into a renderable representation as needed, known
as <dfn>tessellation</dfn>, which generates an approximate version of the
original surface shape in a certain desired quality, controllable by a set
of criteria. It is supported to directly provide the render-time surface
representation to mental ray, for applications which perform all the steps
like modelling, splitting, and tessellation for rendering already.</p>
<p>
Other types of supported geometric entities include curves. They are used
for trimming purposes on surfaces, or for specific modelling and rendering
algorithms in the form of space curves and hair. Since they don't describe
true surfaces they require customized tessellation and shading algorithms
to be renderable.
<p>
Any other type of source geometry can be implemented with the help of geometry
shaders as <dfn>procedural geometry</dfn>. For example, a shader may create
a surface description from a set of input points only, to reconstruct a shape
from a point-sampled model. Typical applications include <em>particle cloud</em>
and <em>surface blob</em> rendering based on point data, as well as <em>fluid</em>
volume or surface effects from a density field.</p>
