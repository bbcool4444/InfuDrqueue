<h3>KD-Tree Functions</h3>
<p>KD trees are acceleration structures that store 3D points in a
<i>k</i>-dimensional space. They provide fast lookup of elements
that are close to a given location. Stored elements consist of two
parts: the location vector and associated arbitrary data. All data
stored in a KD tree must have the same size, but different trees
may have different sizes. Sizes over about 100-200 bytes are not
recommended though, to keep memory usage low and lookups fast; if
more data is needed pointers to the data should be stored instead
of the data itself.</p>
<p>KD trees are implemented as mental ray database elements.
However, access and edit functions are slightly different. The main
difference is that, when a KD tree is accessed or edited, a pointer
to a "handle" is returned, not just the pointer in to DB element
memory. This pointer (always called <i>tree</i> below) is only
valid in the thread that has opened it - it is not possible to
access a KD tree and keeping the pointer for multiple rendered
rectangles because different rectangles are rendered simultaneously
in different threads. For example, it is legal to access a KD tree
in a shader state function in <i>state init</i> mode and unpinning
it in <i>state exit</i> mode, but it is not legal to do the same in
shader init or exit functions because shaders may stay initialized
and in use in multiple threads until rendering finishes.
<i>mi_shaderstate_set</i> is a good way to pass open KD tree
pointers to other shaders.</p>
<p>Like all other data structures under shader control, KD trees
cannot be used across a network of machines. Every host can create
and access its own KD trees, but it cannot access or edit trees on
other hosts. Although KD trees are scene elements that are
identified by tags, which might indicate that they are
network-transparent, they are not - there is no mechanism that
synchronizes multiple writes. Any attempt to do so may overwrite
some changes with others, or fail to propagate changes across the
network at the right time.</p>

    miTag mi_kdtree_create(
        miKdtree_type    type,
        miUint           datasize)
</pre>
<p>The <i>type</i> argument must have the value
<tt>miKDTREE_3D</tt>, which specifies that the tree works with 3D
points in space. Future versions may allow different lookup
dimensions or methods. The <i>datasize</i> argument is the size of
the data not including the size of location coordinates, fixed for
all elements of the new KD tree. The returned tag identifies the
new KD tree for future accesses and edits.</p>
<p><a id="INDEX710"></a></p>
<h5 class="anchor" id="api:mi_kdtree_edit">mi_kdtree_edit</h5>

        const void       *shared_data,
        miUint           shared_data_size)
</pre>
<p>This opens a tree for adding new elements. The
<i>shared_data</i> argument may point to a data structure that is
stored while the KD tree is open for editing. mental ray will not
use this data in any way, but pass it to the insert callback later
when the tree is rebalanced (see below). The
<i>shared_data_size</i> is the size of the structure that
<i>shared_data</i> points to. The caller should release
<i>shared_data</i> after <i><a href="node147.html#INDEX710">mi_kdtree_edit</a></i>
returns, if it was
allocated, because mental ray makes a copy of the data and keeps it
until the next rebalancing operation (see below). Multiple
simultaneous edits are allowed, mental ray resolves any conflicts
automatically. However, the same tree may not be open for reading
(<i><a href="node147.html#INDEX713">mi_kdtree_access</a></i>) an
writing (<i><a href="node147.html#INDEX710">mi_kdtree_edit</a></i>)
simultaneously, even if the conflicting access and edit happen in
different threads.</p>
<p><a id="INDEX711"></a></p>
<h5 class="anchor" id="api:mi_kdtree_add">mi_kdtree_add</h5>
<pre>
    miBoolean mi_kdtree_add(
        struct miKdtree  *tree,
        const void       *data,
        const miScalar   point[])
</pre>
<p>Add a new element to the KD tree. The <i>tree</i> pointer must
have been obtained from a previous call to
<i><a href="node147.html#INDEX710">mi_kdtree_edit</a></i>. The size of the
stored <i>data</i> must agree with the <i>data_size</i> specified
when the tree was created. The <i>point</i> is the 3D position
where the data will be stored. This function is fast, the element
is added to the buffer of elements scheduled for adding. The
function returns <tt>miFALSE</tt> on failure, for example if
<i>tree</i> comes from <i><a href="node147.html#INDEX713">mi_kdtree_access</a></i>
instead of
<i><a href="node147.html#INDEX710">mi_kdtree_edit</a></i>.</p>
<p>Since <i><a href="node147.html#INDEX711">mi_kdtree_add</a></i>
is much faster than <i><a href="node147.html#INDEX710">mi_kdtree_edit</a></i>,
it is a good idea
to add as many points as possible inside an edit/unpin bracket. Do
not edit, add, unpin for every point.</p>
<p><a id="INDEX712"></a></p>
<h5 class="anchor" id="api:mi_kdtree_unpin">mi_kdtree_unpin</h5>
<pre>
    miBoolean mi_kdtree_unpin(
        struct miKdtree  *tree)
</pre>
<p>This function ends accessing or editing. Every call to
<i><a href="node147.html#INDEX713">mi_kdtree_access</a></i> and
<i><a href="node147.html#INDEX710">mi_kdtree_edit</a></i> should
have a corresponding <i><a href="node147.html#INDEX712">mi_kdtree_unpin</a></i>.
The <i>tree</i>
pointer, which must have been obtained from an access or edit,
becomes invalid. However, if the KD tree is not unpinned until the
end of the job (ie. a photon bundle or a rendered rectangle), this
is done automatically. This automatic unpinning should be used with
care; while keeping the tree accessed or edited for a long time is
efficient because the add function is faster than the access and
edit functions, it does not protect the called from simultaneous
access and edit, which is illegal. The function returns
<tt>miTRUE</tt>; there are currently no failure modes.</p>
<p><a id="INDEX713"></a></p>
<h5 class="anchor" id="api:mi_kdtree_access">mi_kdtree_access</h5>
<pre>
    typedef miBoolean ((miKdtree_insert_callback)
        (void                    *callback_data,
         void                    *data,
         miScalar                point[],
         const void              *shared_data));

    struct miKdtree *mi_kdtree_access(
        miTag                    tag,
        miKdtree_insert_callback *callback,
        void                     *callback_data)
</pre>
<p>Opens a KD tree for read-only lookups or iteration over all
elements. Simultaneous access calls for different KD trees,
identified by different <i>tag</i>s, are legal. The returned
<i>tree</i> pointer identifies the accessed KD tree until the the
access is terminated with a call to
<i><a href="node147.html#INDEX712">mi_kdtree_unpin</a></i>.</p>
<p>After a tree was edited and points were added, it requires a
processing phase called <i>rebalancing</i>. Rebalancing is an
expensive operation, and mental ray tries to defer it as long as
possible, in case another point gets added later. However,
accessing the tree for lookup requires a rebalanced tree, so the
rebalancing phase occurs when
<i><a href="node147.html#INDEX713">mi_kdtree_access</a></i> is called.</p>
<p>Rebalancing integrates each point previously stored with
<i><a href="node147.html#INDEX711">mi_kdtree_add</a></i>, and not
yet integrated by a previous rebalance, into the KD tree. If a
nonzero <i>callback</i> argument is specified, this callback will
be called for each point to integrate. The callback may modify the
<i>point</i> and <i>data</i> fields of the point, which were both
specified with <i><a href="node147.html#INDEX711">mi_kdtree_add</a></i>.
The callback also
receives the <i>shared_data</i> structure specify in the last
<i><a href="node147.html#INDEX710">mi_kdtree_edit</a></i> call.
Finally, the callback receives the opaque <i>callback_data</i>
pointer from <i><a href="node147.html#INDEX713">mi_kdtree_access</a></i>;
this can be used
to pass a C++ <i>this</i> pointer to provide context. If the
callback returns <tt>miFALSE</tt>, the point is rejected and not
added.</p>
<p>For example, the callback may be used for energy
renormalization. Light sources may cast photons into the scene, and
store each photon into a single KD tree where it hits a surface.
However, the light sources do not know how many photons will
eventually be cast, so they cast each one with the light energy.
When all photons have been cast, it is necessary to divide the
energy of each photon in the KD tree by the number of photons for
the originating light source. This would be done by the callback;
the photon energy would be stored in the point <i>data</i> by
<i><a href="node147.html#INDEX711">mi_kdtree_add</a></i>, and
information about the light emitter (which is important to find the
number of photons to divide by) would be stored in the
<i>shared_data</i> by <i><a href="node147.html#INDEX710">mi_kdtree_edit</a></i>.
It would be
inefficient to store the light emitter identifier with each added
photon.</p>

    typedef miBoolean ((miKdtree_lookup_callback)
        (void                    *callback_data,
         const void              *data,
         const miScalar          point[]));

    miUint mi_kdtree_lookup(
        struct miKdtree          *tree,

        miKdtree_lookup_callback *callback,
        void                     *callback_data)
</pre>
<p>This function returns points near <i>point</i> in the KD tree
<i>tree</i>, which must have been opened with
<i><a href="node147.html#INDEX713">mi_kdtree_access</a></i>. It finds the
<i>max_n</i> closest elements, which are closer than
<i>max_dist</i>. The distance to the most distant element found is
stored in * <i>max_dist_used</i>, if this pointer is nonzero. The
number of elements found is returned. The <i>callback</i> is called
on each element found, with the opaque <i>callback_data</i>
pointer. If the callback returns <tt>miFALSE</tt>,
<i><a href="node147.html#INDEX714">mi_kdtree_lookup</a></i> returns
immediately. For example, if the KD tree is used for storing
photons, a simple callback could just sum the energy of all
photons.</p>
<p><a id="INDEX715"></a></p>
<h5 class="anchor" id="api:mi_kdtree_iterate">mi_kdtree_iterate</h5>
<pre>
    miBoolean mi_kdtree_iterate(

        miKdtree_lookup_callback *callback,
        void                     *callback_data)
</pre>
<p>This function is similar to a lookup, but it returns all points
in the KD tree, instead of just those that are close to a given
point. Again, the iteration stops if the callback returns
<tt>miFALSE</tt>. <i><a href="node147.html#INDEX715">mi_kdtree_iterate</a></i> returns
<tt>miFALSE</tt> on failure, for example if <i>tree</i> comes from
<i><a href="node147.html#INDEX710">mi_kdtree_edit</a></i> instead
of <i><a href="node147.html#INDEX713">mi_kdtree_access</a></i>.</p>
<p><a id="INDEX716"></a></p>
<h5 class="anchor" id="api:mi_kdtree_delete">mi_kdtree_delete</h5>
<pre>
    miBoolean mi_kdtree_delete(
        miTag                    tag)
</pre>
<p>Deletes the KD tree from the database. All KD tree handles must
be closed by calling <i><a href="node147.html#INDEX712">mi_kdtree_unpin</a></i>
before calling this
function. The function returns <tt>miTRUE</tt>; there are currently
no failure modes.</p>
