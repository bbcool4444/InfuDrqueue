<h2 id="fo:iray">iray Rendering Mode  <span class="new">3.8</span></h2>
<p>
Existing mental ray global illumination techniques typically depend on
interpolation solutions to trade final quality, and use simplified scene
specification for performance, like idealized light sources.
Unlike these solutions, the <dfn>iray rendering mode</dfn> is based on
deterministic and consistent algorithms that converge without introducing
persistent approximation artifacts. These algorithms also allow for extreme
scalability on parallel computing platforms. On machines equipped with
GPU hardware which can be used for general purpose computing, like
graphics processors supporting CUDA, this rendering mode is able to
achieve interactive frame rates with quick progressive refinement to
the desired image quality. This mode enables mental ray to produce images
that include the most anticipated but typically expensive real-world effects,
including (among others):</p>
<ul>
<li>Glossy reflections and refractions,
<li>Image-based and Environment lighting,
<li>Area lights with soft shadows,
<li>Camera lens depth-of-field,
<li>Direct and indirect illumination effects<br />
typically only approximated in traditional workflows by techniques such as
ambient occlusion and final gathering.
</ul>
<p>
In order to achieve this level of realism the scene description - comprising
geometry, materials, light sources, and camera model - is interpreted in a
manner reflecting physically plausible representations, instead of using
traditional shading tricks with theoretical models. The rendering process is
fully based on <a href="node14.html#fo:bsdf">BSDF</a> materials and <dfn>EDF</dfn>
(emission distribution function) light sources, both of which can be coupled
with texturing and controlled through intuitive parameters.
Existing traditional material descriptions implemented in shaders and
established light source types are handled automatically. Programmable
shaders implementing illumination algorithms are not required to produce
photo-real results.
<p>
The iray rendering mode is enabled with a global switch using a
<a href="node76.html#opt:iray">scene option</a> or on the
<a href="node245.html#cli:iray">command line</a> of standalone mental ray.
The iray rendering mode is always computing images in a progressive way and
therefore respects the automatic stop criteria for
<a href="node6.html#fo:progressive">progressive rendering</a>.</p>
