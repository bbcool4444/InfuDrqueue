Materials determine the look of geometric objects.
They are referenced by <i>material_name</i> in the geometry
definition in <tt>object</tt> statements (see below). Lights and
textures cannot be referenced by objects; they are referenced by
the material which uses them to compute the color of a point on the
object's surface. All built-in material shaders accept
<a href="node78.html#INDEX236">texture</a>s and light instances as shader
parameters.</p>
<p>When a <a href="node124.html#INDEX489">primary ray</a> cast from
the camera hits an object, that object's material shader (the first
<i>shader_list</i>) is called. The material shader may be omitted
in fully transparent objects. Such objects are useful as
<b><a id="INDEX244"></a>hull object</b>s for volume
effects such as visible light cones. Such objects will generally
specify <tt>shadowmap off</tt> as well.</p>
<p>The material shader then calculates a color (and certain other
optional values such as <b><a id="INDEX245"></a>label</b>s, Z
<b><a id="INDEX246"></a>depth</b>s, and
<a href="node83.html#INDEX289">normal vector</a>s that can be written to
special output files). This color may then be modified by the
optional <a href="node117.html#INDEX460">volume shader</a> if
present. The resulting color is stored in the output
<a href="node144.html#INDEX617">frame buffer</a>, which is written to the
output picture file when rendering has finished. In order to
calculate the color, the material shader may cast secondary
<a href="node142.html#INDEX581">reflection</a>,
<a href="node115.html#INDEX446">refraction</a>, or
<a href="node76.html#INDEX200">transparency</a> rays, which in turn may hit
objects and cause other (or the same; multiple objects may share a
material) material shaders to be called. The material shader bases
the decision whether to cast secondary rays on its parameters,
which are part of the scene description and may contain parameters
such as the material's <a href="node19.html#INDEX30">diffuse
color</a> or its reflectivity and <a href="node76.html#INDEX200">transparency</a>,
light instances, and
<a href="node78.html#INDEX236">texture</a>s. The parameters depend
entirely on the material shader. In this sense, material shaders
are "primary" shaders that get help from "secondary" texture and
light shaders.</p>
<p>It is possible to specify a shader type such as <tt>shadow</tt>
without following it with a <i>shader_list</i>. This is useful if
an <a href="node60.html#INDEX110">incremental change</a> is done to
the material. The incremental change leaves the contents of the
material undisturbed except where explicitly rewritten, so the
shadow shader list remains intact. It can be replaced by specifying
a new one, but it can only be deleted with a <tt>shadow</tt>
keyword not followed by any shaders. In an incremental change, the
first statement (say, <tt>volume</tt>) first resets the old volume
list; every subsequent <tt>volume</tt> statement in the same
material block adds to the list.</p>
<p>The <i>material_name</i> should be quoted to avoid conflicts
with reserved names and non-alphabetic characters. The
<tt>opaque</tt> flag, if present, informs mental ray that this
material is not transparent (i.e., it does not cast
<a href="node115.html#INDEX446">refraction</a> or
<a href="node76.html#INDEX200">transparency</a> rays and always sets its
alpha result value to 1); this allows certain optimizations that
improve rendering speed. The material shader and its parameters are
the only mandatory part of a material.</p>
<p>There are several optional functions that can be listed in a
material. The <a href="node127.html#INDEX494">displacement
shader</a> is a function returning a scalar that displaces the
object's surface in the direction of its normal, or in arbitrary
directions. Displacement shaders can be applied to both free-form
surface objects and polygonal objects.</p>
<p>The <b><a id="INDEX247"></a>shadow shader</b> is
called when a <a href="node76.html#INDEX197">shadow</a> calculation
is done, and the <a href="node120.html#INDEX472">shadow ray</a>
from the light source towards the point in shadow intersects with
this material. The shadow shader then changes the color of the ray,
which is initially the (possibly attenuated) color of the light to
another color, typically a darker or tinted color if the material
is colored glass. It returns black if the material is totally
opaque, which is also the default if no shadow shader is present.
Shadow shaders are usually reduced versions of the material
shaders; they evaluate transparencies and colors but cast no
secondary rays. Shadow shaders are only required for transparent
objects. If <a href="node48.html#INDEX95">global illumination</a>
is enabled, no shadow shaders should be used because global
illumination provides a more powerful way to compute light
transmission, and using two "competing" methods at the same time
for the same object may produce incorrect results.</p>
<p>It is possible to use the material shader as a shadow shader;
material shaders can find out whether they are called as material
or shadow shaders and do only the required subset in the latter
case. This is done by naming the material shader after the
<tt>shadow</tt> keyword, and giving no parameters (i.e., giving
<tt>()</tt>). mental ray will notice the absence of parameters and
pass the material parameters instead. If the shadow shader has no
parameters of its own, it is not defined whether it receives a
pointer to the material shader parameters, or a pointer to a copy
of the material shader parameters.</p>
<p>A <a href="node117.html#INDEX460">volume shader</a> affects rays
traveling inside an object. Volume shaders are conceptually similar
to <a href="node117.html#INDEX461">fog</a> or
<a href="node117.html#INDEX462">atmosphere</a> shaders of other rendering
programs. When a ray (either from the eye or from a light source)
hits this material, the volume shader, if present, is called to
change the color returned by the ray based on the distance the ray
has traveled, and atmospheric or material parameters. A volume
shader can also be named in the <tt>camera</tt> (see above); that
shader is used for rays traveling outside objects. It is the
material shader's responsibility to determine inside and outside of
objects.</p>
<p>The <a href="node119.html#INDEX468">environment shader</a> is
called when a <a href="node142.html#INDEX581">reflection</a> or
<a href="node115.html#INDEX446">refraction</a> ray cast by the
material shader leaves the scene entirely without striking another
object. For example, the environment shader may map a texture on a
sphere with an infinite radius surrounding the scene. (This is
another example for an application of a texture; a texture name
must be used as a parameter for the environment shader for this to
work.) The <tt>camera</tt> statement also allows naming an
environment shader; that shader is used when the ray leaves the
scene without ever striking any object (or exceeding the
<a href="node76.html#INDEX196">trace depth</a>).</p>
<p>If a <a href="node92.html#INDEX0">contour</a> shader is given,
it is called when contours are enabled with an appropriate
<a href="node77.html#INDEX227">output statement</a> in the camera element,
and certain contour store and contour contrast shaders are
specified in the options element. For more information on contour
rendering see section <a href="node92.html#contour">contour</a>.</p>
<p>If caustics or global illumination computation is enabled, the
photon shader is called during a preprocessing stage (before
rendering) to determine the light distribution in the scene. Like
shadow shaders, photon shaders without parameter lists are called
with the material shader parameter lists.</p>
<p>A <b><a id="INDEX248"></a>volume photon
shader</b> affects photons traveling inside an object. When a
photon hits this material, the volume photon shader, if present, is
called to trace the photon through the volume. Volume photon
shaders are to volume shaders what photon shaders are to material
shaders.</p>
<p>The <a href="node135.html#INDEX501">lightmap shader</a>,
if present, is called for the object that the material is attached to,
and is expected to create a <a href="node25.html#INDEX49">light map</a> 
other information collection about the object that can be saved to disk
or used during rendering. In its most common form, the shader creates a
texture that contains the illumination of the object; hence the term
"<a href="node25.html#INDEX49">light map</a>".</p>
<p id="mi:material_bsdf"><span class="recent">3.7</span>
The <a href="brdf_sh.html">BRDF shader</a> attached to the
<code class="mi">bsdf</code> slot specifies a common shading model to be used
for illumination effects where the corresponding shader is not available,
including the main material shader.
</p>

<p id="matphen">
Materials can be replaced with phenomena. In all places where the name of a
material may be given, the name of a shader that references a phenomenon
declaration of type <tt>material</tt> is legal. Given the following scene
fragment:</p>
<pre>
     declare phenomenon
          material "phen_mtl" (color "param")
          material "mtl" opaque
               "shader" ("diffuse" = interface "param")
          end material
          root material "mtl"
     end declare

     shader "mtl_sh" "phen_mtl" ("param" 1.0 0.7 0.3)
</pre>
<p>the name <tt>mtl_sh</tt> can be used like a
<i>material_name</i>, for example in polygon or free-form surface
definitions in objects. For more information on material phenomena,
see section <a href="node179.html#phenomenon">phenomenon</a>.</p>
<p>Note that there are three ways to use materials in a scene:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every polygon and surface in an object specifies a material.
They can be omitted but default to the previous polygon or surface
in the object, but this is only a syntactical simplification.
Effectively, every polygon and surface brings its own material, and
no <a href="node90.html#INDEX344">material inheritance</a> takes
place.</li>
<li>If the object is marked <tt>tagged</tt>, polygons and surfaces
do not specify materials but integer labels. In this case the
inherited material in the instance is used. That material can use
<i><a href="miquery.html#api:mi_query">mi_query</a></i> to obtain the
label and modify its behavior based on the label.</li>
<li>As a variation of the previous method, the instance may specify
not a single material but a list of materials. In this case, mental
ray will use the <i>n</i>-th material in the list if the label of
the intersected primitive is <i>n</i> (or the first material if the
label is greater than or equal to the number of materials in the
list).</li>
</ul>
<p>See section <a href="node90.html#instance">instance</a> for more
details on material lists and material inheritance.</p>
