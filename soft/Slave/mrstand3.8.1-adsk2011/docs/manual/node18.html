<h2 if="fo:shadowmap">Shadow Maps</h2>

<p id="INDEX22"><a id="INDEX23"></a>
<dfn if="shadowmaps">Shadow mapping</dfn> is a technique that generates fast
approximate shadows. It can be used for fast previewing of models
or as an alternative to the more accurate (but also more costly)
<a href="node140.html#INDEX556">ray marching</a> based approach in
scenes where accurate shadows are not required. Shadow maps are
particularly efficient when a scene is rendered several times
without changes in the shadows (for example an animation where some
of the lights and shadow-casting objects are not moving).
<p>
A <dfn id="shadowmap">shadow map</dfn> is a fast depth buffer rendering
of the model as seen from a light source. This means that each pixel in
a shadow map contains information about the distance to the nearest object
in the model in a particular direction from the light source. This
information can be used to compute shadows without using shadow
rays to test for occluding objects. The shadow computation is based
only on the depth information available in the shadow maps. For
fast previewing of scenes, shadow maps can be used in combination
with scanline rendering to produce fast approximate renderings with
shadows - without using any <a href="node140.html#INDEX556">ray
marching</a>.</p>
<p>Two different kinds of shadows can be produced with shadow maps:
sharp and soft (blurry) shadows. Sharp shadows are very fast, and
depending on the resolution of the shadow map they will approximate
the result produced with simple <a href="node140.html#INDEX556">ray
marching</a>. Soft shadows are produced by distributing one or more
samples in a region of the shadow map. This technique produces
<a href="node16.html#INDEX19">soft shadow</a>s everywhere and is
not as accurate as the <a href="node140.html#INDEX556">ray
marching</a> based approach for computing soft shadows but is much
faster.</p>
<p>Shadowmaps normally store the halfway point between the first
two shadow intersections, which is called the "<b><a name="INDEX24"
id="INDEX24"></a>Woo trick</b>". If there is no second hit, 0
(infinity) is stored because no shadow can exist, since there is no
second object that the shadow could be cast onto. However, the
second hit can come from a previous render whose shadowmap we are
merging, so 0 (infinite) depths can occur in both the old and the
new shadowmap because both saw only one hit, but together that's
two hits and there should have been a nonzero depth. Hence,
<a href="node80.html#INDEX263">shadowmap merging</a> is
fundamentally incompatible with the Woo algorithm.</p>
<p>mental ray also implements a shadowmap algorithm based on
explicit <b><a id="INDEX25"></a>shadowmap bias</b>
values. The bias is a world-space distance stored in the
<a href="node76.html#INDEX180">options block</a> and
<a href="node80.html#INDEX250">light source</a> definitions. Lights
override the options; the options apply to all lights that do not
have their own bias. A bias of zero means "no bias"; a light that
gets a non-zero bias uses the bias algorithm while all others use
the Woo algorithm. Bias values should be chosen smaller than the
smallest distance between a shadow caster and a shadow receiver,
but not too small to avoid shadow acne due to numerical inaccuracy.
The bias algorithm stores the depth of the first intersection
directly, after adding the bias value, without looking for a second
intersection.</p>
<p>Shadowmaps saved to files store the bias value, and the actual
depths from the light with no bias applied. The bias is applied
during lookup, not during storage. When the shadowmap file is later
loaded from disk, the bias of the new scene and not the one stored
in the shadowmap will be used. As an exception, if the shadowmap
file contains a bias but the new frame does not (because it uses
the midpoint Woo algorithm), the old file is adjusted by its bias
on loading. This allows merging biased and Woo maps, but it is not
recommended.</p>
<p>To set a bias in a light or the options in the scene file, use
the statement <tt>shadowmap bias N</tt>. The options bias can also
be set with the command-line argument <tt>-shadowmap_bias
N</tt>.</p>
<p>Standard shadow maps always assume that shadow-casting objects
are fully opaque, and never call <a href="node121.html#INDEX481">shadow
shader</a>s. mental ray also supports
<i>detail shadowmaps</i><a id="INDEX26"></a> that collect more information
about shadow-casting
objects. They have features that are a combination of standard
shadow maps and raytraced shadows. In most aspects they behave like
standard shadow maps, but they also call <a href="node121.html#INDEX481">shadow
shader</a>s if present. Since shadow
shaders return transparencies, detail shadowmaps do not store a
simple depth value, but a list of depth values together with the
light transmission coefficients at each depth. Detail shadowmaps
are more expensive to calculate than standard shadow maps, since
they may invoke shadow shaders. They typically store more
information per pixel than standard shadow maps.</p>
