<h3>Shader Interfaces</h3>
<p>
<span class="depr">Deprecated</span>
<p>
To realize the goal of providing inaccurate but fast previews,
it is important to replace any software node with a hardware node,
or omit it altogether, and still obtain a reasonable simplified
image. Global illumination has no hardware equivalent, but a
software shader that renders an object layer (such as the three
object nodes in the above graphs) may have an equivalent or
simplified hardware version. This requires that a shader interface
is introduced that allows defining hardware and software shaders
that provide a similar interface to the scene. The following
intrinsic differences need to be abstracted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software shaders have inputs and outputs. It is possible to
create graphs of shaders where shaders obtain their inputs from the
outputs of other shaders. Such graphs can be used to create
Phenomena, which encapsulate one or more shader graphs and other
information such that the Phenomenon appears like a monolithic
shader. This allows a separation of functions: different components
of a complex effect may be built from simple shaders, each taking
care of some aspect of the effect.</li>
<li>Hardware shaders consist of two functions, one modifying
geometry and precalculating data (called the <b><a name="INDEX850"
id="INDEX850"></a>vertex shader</b>), and one doing the actual
shading calculation (the <b><a id="INDEX851"></a>fragment shader</b>).
There is also a constant
shared data storage called <b><a id="INDEX852"></a>uniform variable</b>s.
Both types of shaders are
monolithic; it is not possible to build up complex effects from
simple dedicated functions. Also, the <a href="node178.html#INDEX855">uniform
variable</a>s are the only place to
pass input parameters to both types of shaders. Most importantly,
mental ray's separation of surface, volume, texture, and light
shaders cannot be represented in hardware.
<p>However, <a href="node178.html#INDEX854">NVIDIA</a>'s
<a href="node173.html#INDEX853">Cg</a> 1.2 shader language compiler has the
ability to compile the shader nodes of Phenomena and their
connections into monolithic hardware shaders. This was developed in
close cooperation between <a href="node178.html#INDEX854">NVIDIA</a>
and mental images.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the implementation is obviously different, both
software shaders and hardware shaders accept parameters in a
similar way. mental ray supports mapping standard mental ray shader
parameters to <a href="node178.html#INDEX855">uniform
variable</a>s, unpacking information into a form that the hardware
shaders can use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple data formats such as vectors, floats, and matrices can
be stored in <a href="node178.html#INDEX855">uniform variable</a>s
without change.</li>
<li>Integers and booleans require conversion to floating-point
format.</li>
<li>Lights require obtaining light information from the referenced
light instances and light elements, such as position, orientation,
cone angles, and energy, storing the resulting data set in
<a href="node178.html#INDEX855">uniform variable</a>s. Lights must be part
of the material definition otherwise they will no be part of the
illumination calculation in the <a href="node168.html#INDEX851">fragment
shader</a>.</li>
<li>Textures and other maps require preloading the necessary
textures into hardware memory, probably at a reduced resolution to
fit into the limited space. The necessary reference data is stored
in <a href="node178.html#INDEX855">uniform variable</a>s.</li>
</ul>
<p>Software shaders have no inherent limit on the number of lights
and textures. Hardware shaders do, because the number of
<a href="node178.html#INDEX855">uniform variable</a>s, registers or number
of instructions are rather limited. Effects that would exceed this
limit require layering. For example, if there is only room for ten
lights in the <a href="node178.html#INDEX855">uniform variable</a>s
but the shader's light list contains twenty, the shader must be
called twice to layer the effect. The design does not attempt to
automate this at this time because it is not known how lights and
other parameters interact. If the shader fails to load, it will
either render with a default hardware material or with rendered the
software version.</p>
