<h2 id="SECTION95">Pass Rendering</h2>
<p>
<a id="INDEX354"></a><a id="INDEX355"></a> <a id="renderpass"></a>
Pass rendering allows rendering multiple scenes with the same
<a href="node199.html#INDEX1061">frame number</a>, resolution, oversampling
parameters, and list of type of frame buffers, but different contents.
This is useful if a scene is extremely complex, or consists of many
distinct elements, so that rendering it all at once is impractical
either because of the size, or because certain elements are expected
to change and it would be too expensive to re-render the entire scene
for each small change. Pass rendering allows splitting such a scene
into sub-scenes (called passes or layers), rendering each sub-scene, and
putting the results together in a separate step called <i>merging</i>.
<p>
Scenes are typically broken into sub-scenes by clustering geometry, for
example one for each complex character or creature, or props such as
vehicles, or backgrounds. Elements not present in a sub-scene are either
omitted completely or replaced by very simple stand-ins that do not appear
in the rendered pass image, for example simple invisible and nontraceable
objects that cast shadows. This allows objects of one pass to cast shadows
on objects in another pass.
<p>
Each pass render leaves a pass file in a directory specified by the user,
using a <tt>pass</tt> statement list in the camera definition. Pass
statements come in five forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>pass write "</tt> <i>filename</i> <tt>"</tt><br />
<br />
Save the current set of samples belonging to each rendered
rectangle to the file <i>filename</i>.</li>
<li><tt>pass merge read [...] write "</tt> <i>fn</i> <tt>"</tt>
<i>shader</i><br />
<br />
Merge the comma-separated list of pass file names in angle
brackets, where a null file name ( <tt>""</tt>) stands for the
current render results, and save the merged pass data. The options
<i>shader</i> performs the merging. The default performs a depth
and alpha blending merge.</li>
<li><tt>pass prep read "</tt> <i>fn</i> <tt>" write "</tt>
<i>fn</i> <tt>"</tt> <i>shader</i><br />
<br />
Preprocess a pass file. The <i>shader</i> has random access to all
samples.</li>
<li><tt>pass delete "</tt> <i>fn</i> <tt>"</tt><br />
<br />
Delete the file.</li>
<li><tt>pass null</tt><br />
<br />
Delete all pass statements in the camera.</li>
</ul>
<p>All pass prep statements are executed in order before rendering.
During rendering, all pass and pass merge statements are executed
in order, once for each finished rectangle. After rendering, all
delete statements are executed. For more information on the syntax,
see page <a href="node77.html#mpassopt">mpassopt</a>.</p>
<p>Merging is the operation of combining all samples for a pixel,
sample by sample, to arrive at the final sample to be filtered into
the pixel. Merging may simply choose the sample with the lowest
depth, or also perform alpha blending or other operations based on
the available frame buffers. Merging can either happen at the end
of the last pass, or as a separate operation. mental ray will merge
without rendering if there is no pass statement (of the first type
above). If merging without rendering, it is still necessary to
provide some information about the scene that agrees with the
settings in the pass sub-scenes:</p>
<ul>
<li>an options block with a <tt>samples</tt> statement.</li>
<li>a camera with <tt>pass</tt>, <tt>output</tt>, and
<tt>resolution</tt> statements.</li>
<li>a camera instance and root group containing the camera
instance, and a render statement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that when using the rasterizer, the <tt>shading
samples</tt> setting is used in place of the <tt>samples</tt>
setting.</p>
<p>The pass statement specifies the current pass number, the number
of passes, and an optional directory to store the pass files (which
can become large if there are many samples and many defined frame
buffers, much larger than image files). Here is an example scene
for merging only:</p>
<p><a id="rpassex"></a></p>
<pre>
    link "passmerge.so"
    declare shader "mymerge" () version 1 end declare

    options "opt"
        samples         -2 1
    end options

    camera "cam"
        frame           1
        pass merge      read [ "pass.0", "pass.1", "pass.2" ] "mymerge" ()
        output          "rgb" "out.rgb"
        resolution      150 128
    end camera 

    instance "cam_inst" "cam" end instance
    instgroup "rootgrp" "cam_inst" end instgroup
    render "rootgrp" "cam_inst" "opt"
</pre>
<p>Note that the camera specifies no <tt>pass write</tt> statement,
so no rendering takes place and no geometry needs to be specified
here. (If it were, it would be ignored.) The
<a href="node136.html#INDEX507">pass merge shader</a> "mymerge" is
responsible for putting the render passes together, sample by
sample. Its implementation is described on page
<a href="node136.html#passmerge">passmerge</a>. The example there merges
the scenes by Z depth, and since the merging is based on individual
samples, any intersections will be properly anti-aliased (which
they would not if the merging were based on images). If no merge
shader is specified, mental ray will default to a simple depth
sorting function with alpha blending.</p>
<p>Note, however, that each pass is a separate scene with no
knowledge about other scenes. This means that at points where
objects in one pass intersect with objects in another pass in the
final image, mental ray sees no reason to oversample the
intersection because it does not exist at that time. Although
mental ray will reconstruct low-sampling areas before merging, it
may occasionally be necessary to use sampling parameters where the
minimum number of samples is close to, or in extreme cases (where
the objects are simple and nearly flat-shaded but highly detailed
inter-pass intersections take place) even equal to the maximum
number of samples. It is also recommended to turn jittering off
because different passes may jitter sample position in different
ways.</p>
<p>For the merge example above to work, it is necessary to first
render the three pass files. This is done by adding pass statements
to the camera:</p>
<pre>
    camera "cam"
        ...
        pass write "pass.0"
        ...
    end camera
</pre>
<p>And similar for passes 1 and 2. These files are otherwise normal
scene files. As mentioned before, the resolution and sampling
parameters, and list of frame buffers (as defined by
<tt>output</tt> and <tt>frame buffer</tt> statements) must agree.
Pass files from hosts with different byte orders cannot be merged.
No <tt>pass merge</tt> statements are required, unless merging
should be done after rendering too. Note that if merging and
rendering is done in one step, the pass being rendered is
referenced in the pass merge statement with an empty string (
<tt>""</tt>). This can be done in any pass - if rendering pass 2 of
3, for example, the pass merge statement would be</p>
<pre>
    pass merge read [ "pass.0", "", "pass.2" ]
    output "rgb" "rgb.out"
</pre>
<p>Note that pass files are not intended for long-term archival.
Although different versions of mental ray will generally accept the
same pass merge files, major revisions may alter the file format.
An informational warning will be printed if the version numbers do
not agree, but this warning can be ignored. mental ray will detect
incompatibilities and reject pass files that have the wrong
version, resolution etc., or the wrong byte order.</p>
<p>If pass mode is enabled, mental ray will automatically enable the
depth (Z) frame buffer. This may change in future versions.</p>
