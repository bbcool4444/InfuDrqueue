<p>Textures are lookup functions. They
come in two flavors: lookups of two-dimensional texture or picture
files or literal bytes, and procedural lookups. File textures
require a file name parameter or a byte list; procedural textures
require a shading function parameter. There are three types of
texture functions: textures computing scalars, colors, and vectors.
Which one is chosen depends on what the texture is used for.
Textures are used as parameters to other shaders, typically
material shaders. A material shader could, for example, use a
color texture to wrap a picture around an object, or a scalar
texture as a transparency or displacement map, or a vector texture
as a bump map. The actual use of the texture result is entirely up
to the shader that uses the texture.</p>
<p>All of the above syntax variations define a texture
<i>texture_name</i>. The <i>texture_name</i> should be quoted to
avoid reserved words and to allow non-alphabetic characters. This
is the name that the texture will later be referenced as.</p>
<p>Verbatim or writable non-procedural textures can be defined by
specifying the <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> of the texture and an
optional <i>depth</i> (bytes per component, 1, 2, or 4, default is 1).
For verbatim textures, a list of <span style="white-space:nowrap">
<var>width &times; height &times; depth</var></span>
hexadecimal two-digit bytes follows, most significant digit first
if <i>depth</i> is 2 or 4, in RGBA order for colors and UV order
for vectors. Note, that the brackets around the sizes are literally
part of the <tt>.mi</tt> file, while the skinny brackets around
<i>depth</i> denote that the depth is optional and not part of the
<tt>.mi</tt> file. These textures are called <b><a name="INDEX240"
id="INDEX240"></a>verbatim textures</b>, and should be used with
care because they can increase the scene file size enormously.
Writable textures are primarily useful as the output of light
mapping.</p>
<a id="mmap"></a>
<p>Non-procedural textures can also
be defined by naming a texture or picture file. For a list of supported
file formats, see page <a href="node19.html#picformats">file formats</a>.
In this case, the sizes (width, height, and depth) are read from the file.
If the <tt>local</tt> keyword is not present, the file is read once on the
master host and then transmitted over the network to all slave
hosts that participate in the rendering. With the <tt>local</tt>
keyword, only the file name is transmitted to the slave hosts; the file
is expected to exists locally on slave hosts. This allows to distribute
the texture files to all the remote machines once by manual copying, thus
reducing network transfer times during mental ray rendering drastically.
Filename rewriting is available for interpreting the remote filename locally,
for example to translate between Unix and Windows file paths. Maximum speed
improvements are achieved if local files are memory-mapped pyramids (see the
<tt>-p</tt> option of the <a href="node249.html#INDEX1088">imf_copy</a>
tool), and reside on local disks and not on network-mounted file systems.
Most efficient memory usage together with reasonable performance, on the
other hand, is achieved by using tiled <a href="node19.html#picformats">
texture formats</a> which benefit from
<a href="texcache.html#fo:texture_caching">texture caching</a>.
</p>

<a id="INDEX241"></a>
<p>If the <tt>writable</tt>
keyword is present, the texture is written to a file after it was
written by a shader. This kind of texture is used by
<a href="node135.html#INDEX501">lightmap shader</a>s to write back the
<a href="node25.html#INDEX49">light map</a>ping result. Light
mapping involves scanning the surface of an object, and collecting
data for each point. This data is later written to a texture file.
A typical example is "baking" <a href="node80.html#INDEX259">indirect
illumination</a> into a texture
that can then be simply texture-mapped at a later render pass,
instead of computing the information at rendering time. If
<tt>writable</tt> is specified, <tt>local</tt> should be specified
as well because the file should be written to disk on the master
host only. Writable textures always have to give the texture height
and width in pixels. The depth may be given explicitely or be
inferred from the <a href="node38.html#INDEX78">file type</a>. The
file format of the file is usually derived from the file extension,
but it is possible to provide an explicit
<a href="node38.html#fo:outformat">file format</a>.</p>

<p id="mi:filter_texture">
The <tt>filter</tt> keyword, if present, enables texture filtering based
on <a href="node19.html#INDEX36">texture pyramid</a>s, a technique comparable
to <a href="node22.html#INDEX46">mip-map texture</a>s. Filtered textures are
preprocessed before rendering begins and use approximately 30% more memory.
Filtering should be used when the texture is large and seen at a distance,
such that every sample covers many texture pixels. Without filtering, widely
spaced samples "overlook" the areas between the samples; filtered textures
perform a filter operation to take the skipped areas into account.
The compression of the texture on the viewing plane can be scaled
by the optional <i>scale</i> value if necessary.</p>

<p>Color textures may be flagged with an optional <code>colorprofile</code>.
The texture is then assumed to be given in the color space
described by this profile. The color values of the texture will be
transformed to render color space before they are used.</p>

<p>When loading a texture image from a file, mental ray checks whether the
texture is memory-mappable. This is the case if the texture file is stored
in the special uncompressed <tt>.map</tt> format. In this case, the
texture is not loaded into memory but mapped into virtual memory.
Memory-mapped textures use far less physical memory and no swap space,
they use virtual memory only (practically reducing available memory on
computers with limited address range, like 32bit machines). Memory mapping
might especially be useful for large textures that are not used often (i.e.,
many or most of its pixels are not sampled or the textured object is small
or far away from the camera). Memory-mapped textures are implicitly also local
textures. In addition, they always need to fit the byte order of the CPU on
the local machine, otherwise they are read as regular files because they can
not be memory mapped. Memory-map textures should be created with the
<a href="node249.html#INDEX1088">imf_copy</a> utility, with the <tt>-p</tt>
option to create pyramids. Note, that the filter scale value is stored
in the texture file as well, any other <var>scale</var> constant specified
in the scene texture definition referencing such files is ignored. Note also,
that color profiles should not be applied to memory mapped textures, since
the resulting color space transformations would attempt to overwrite the
original texture files with the color transformed textures.</p>

<p>Procedural textures are defined by naming a shading function
with parameters; the shading function can either be one of the
built-in functions or an external function from a <tt>code</tt> or
<tt>link</tt> command.</p>
<p>When a shader evaluates a texture by calling a texture
evaluation function, the program either looks up non-procedural
shaders by looking up the texture in the range <i>[0, 1)</i> in
each dimension, or it calls the named shader in the procedural
case. The shader is free to interpret the point for which it
evaluates the texture in any way it wants, two-dimensional or
three-dimensional.</p>
