<h2>Bump, Displacement, and Reflection Mapping</h2>
<p>Just as a <a href="node19.html#INDEX27">texture map</a> can vary
a parameter such as the diffuse color over every point on a
surface, a <b><a id="INDEX39"></a>bump map</b> can
be associated with a <a href="node79.html#INDEX242">material</a>,
perturbing the normal at every point on a surface which uses the
material, simply by applying an appropriate shader. This will
affect the shading, though not the geometry, giving the illusion of
a pattern being embossed on the surface.</p>
<p>Bump maps, like <a href="node19.html#INDEX27">texture map</a>s,
require a texture space. In addition, bump maps require a pair of
<i>basis vectors</i> to define the coordinate system in which the
normal is displaced. A <a href="node21.html#INDEX39">bump map</a>
defines a scalar <i>x</i> and a scalar <i>y</i> displacement over
the texture space. These components are used together with the
respective basis vectors in order to calculate a perturbed surface
normal. The basis vectors can be automatically defined for
<a href="node9.html#INDEX13">free-form surface</a>s in a way which conforms
to the texture space; for polygons and
<a href="node189.html#INDEX993">subdivision surface</a>s, the basis vectors
must be explicitly given along with the <a href="node108.html#INDEX409">texture
coordinate</a>s for every polygon
vertex. However, most commonly basis vectors are computed
procedurally by shaders during rendering.</p>
<p><a id="INDEX40"></a><a id="INDEX41"></a><b>displacement map</b> is a
<b><a id="INDEX42"></a>scalar map</b> which is used to displace a
<a href="node9.html#INDEX13">free-form surface</a>,
<a href="node83.html#INDEX297">polygon</a>, or
<a href="node189.html#INDEX993">subdivision surface</a> at each point in
the direction of the local normal. Like texture, bump and
<b><a id="INDEX43"></a>reflection map</b>s,
<a href="node21.html#INDEX41">displacement map</a>s are controlled by
shaders that are used by mental ray to determine the displacement
of points on the surface, in order to decide how to deform the
surface and introduce geometric detail.</p>
<p>The surface must be triangulated finely enough to reveal the
details of the displacement map. In general, the triangles must be
smaller than the smallest feature of the displacement map which is
to be resolved.</p>
<p>Displacement mapped polygons are at first triangulated as
ordinary polygons. The initial triangulation is then further
subdivided according to the specified approximation criteria. The
parametric technique subdivides each triangle a given number of
times. All the other techniques take the displacement into account.
The length criterion, for example, limits the size of the edges of
the triangles of the displaced polygons and ensures that at least
all features of this size are resolved. As the displaced surface is
not known analytically, the distance criterion compares the
displacements of the vertices of a triangle with each other. The
criterion is fulfilled only if they differ by less than the given
threshold. Subdivision is finest in areas where the displacement
changes. The angle criterion limits the angle under which two
triangles meet in an edge contained in the triangulation.
Subdivision stops as soon as the given criterion or combination of
them is satisfied or the maximum subdivision level is reached. This
does not preclude the possibility that at an even finer scale new
details may show up which would again violate the approximation
criteria.</p>
<p>mental ray supports rendering
<a href="node189.html#INDEX993">subdivision surface</a>s natively, and
handles displacement mapping on
<a href="node189.html#INDEX993">subdivision surface</a> as part of the
tessellation to the limit surface. If detailed displacement on a
smooth polygon mesh is the primary goal then the
<a href="catmullclark.html">ccmesh</a> primitive should be used for its
superior performance.</p>
<p>For displacement mapped free-form surfaces approximation
techniques can be specified either on the underlying geometric
surface or for the surface resulting from the displacement. If one
wants to control the <a href="node89.html#INDEX334">approximation</a>
from the geometric
surface, the most suitable technique for use with displacement
mapping on free-from surfaces is usually the view dependent uniform
spatial subdivision technique, which allows specification of
triangle size in <a href="node101.html#INDEX371">raster
space</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to or even instead of specifying the subdivision
criteria for the base surface, they can be given for the displaced
surface itself. This approximation statement works exactly the same
way as for polygons, i.e. an initial tessellation is subdivided
until the criteria on the displaced surface are met.</p>
<p>The final type of map is an <b><a id="INDEX44"></a>environment map</b>.
This is a color-mapped virtual
sphere of usually infinite radius which surrounds any object
referencing the given <a href="node79.html#INDEX242">material</a>.
This sphere is also seen by refracted rays; the environment seen by
first-generation (primary) rays can also be specified but is part
of the <tt>camera</tt>, not of any particular material. In general,
if a ray does not intersect any objects, or if casting such a ray
would exceed the <a href="node76.html#INDEX196">trace depth</a>,
the ray is considered to strike the sphere of the
<a href="node21.html#INDEX44">environment map</a> of the last material
visited, or the <tt>camera</tt> environment map in the case of
first-generation rays that did not hit any material. An
<a href="node119.html#INDEX468">environment shader</a> is used to determine
the color of each point of the sphere.</p>
<p>The <a href="node21.html#INDEX44">environment map</a> always
covers the entire sphere exactly once. Rotations, translations, and
repetitions are supported by special shader parameters or remapping
shader nodes such as the ones found in the base shader library.
There are also environment shaders that implement cubical instead
of spherical environment maps, and cubical maps of finite instead
of infinite size.</p>
<p>As described before, textures can be used for any purpose
whatever to control shader behavior, in addition to the examples in
this section.</p>
