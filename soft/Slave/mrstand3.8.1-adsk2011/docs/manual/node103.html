<h2>State Variables</h2>

<p id="INDEX394">
Every shader needs to access information about the current
state of mental ray, and information about the intersection that led to the
shader call. This information is stored in a single structure known as the
<dfn id="sh:shader_state">shader state</dfn>, or simply called
<dfn id="sh:state">state</dfn>. Not all information in the state is of interest
or defined for all shaders; for example, lens shaders are called before an
intersection is done and hence have no information such as the intersection
point or the normal there.
<p>
Before a shader is called, mental ray prepares a new state structure that
provides global information to the shader. This state may be the same data
structure that was used in the previous call, which s is the case for shaders
that modify another shader's result, like lens, shadow, and volume shaders.
Or it may be a new state structure that is a copy of the calling shader's
state with some state variables changed. This is done if a secondary ray is
cast with one of the tracing functions provided by mental ray. For example,
if a material shader that is using state <var>A</var> casts a reflected ray,
which hits another object and causes that object's material shader to be
called with state <var>B</var>, state <var>B</var> will be a copy of state
<var>A</var> except for the ray and intersection information, which will be
different in states <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>. The state <var>A</var> is
said to be the <dfn>parent</dfn> of state <var>B</var>. The state contains a
<code>parent</code> pointer that allows sub-shader to access the state of the
parent shader. If a volume shader is called after the material shader, the
volume shader modifies the color calculated by the material shader, and gets
the same state as the material shader, instead of a fresh copy.
<p>
The state also contains a <code>child</code> pointer that, together with the
<code>parent</code> pointer, forms a double-linked list of states. After a
shader casts a ray, the state copy used by that ray remains available after
the trace call returns. This means, if a trace call returns true, the shader
has full access to the intersection information, label value, and all other
state variables used by the child shader. For example, the shader for a
completely transparent object may decide to copy the <var>label</var> from
<code>state&rarr;child&rarr;label</code> to <code>state&rarr;label</code>
after <a href="node140.html#api:mi_trace_transparent">mi_trace_transparent</a>
has returned. Note, that only the most recent child state is retained; thus
<code>state&rarr;child&rarr;child</code> is undefined.
<p id="INDEX395">
It is possible to pass information from one shader to another in the call
tree for a primary ray by one of two methods: either the parent (the caller)
changes its own state that will be inherited by the child, or, the child may
set variables in the state of the parent by following the <code>parent</code>
pointer. Care must be taken not to destroy information in the state because
some shaders (shadow, volume, and the first eye shader) re-use the state from
any previous call. The state can <em>not</em> be used to pass information from
one primary (camera) ray to the next. Static variables in the shader may be
used for this purpose, but can pose problems on multi-processor shared-memory
machines where the same shader may be executed simultaneously but still share
the static variables. mental ray provides locking facilities to synchronize
access to such variables and to protect critical sections supposed to be run
only once at any time.
<p>
The state contains a <b id="INDEX396">user pointer</b> that a parent can
store the address of a local data structure in, for passing it to sub-shaders.
Since every sub-shader inherits this pointer, it may access information
provided by its parent. A typical application of this are inside/outside
calculations performed by material shaders to find out whether the ray is
inside a closed object to base the interpretation of parameters such as
the <a href="node76.html#INDEX201">index of refraction</a> on.
<p>
The next sections provide a complete list of state variables usable
by shaders. Variables not listed here are for internal use only and
should not be accessed or modified by shaders. Some variables are available
only in some types of shaders; see the <a href="node111.html#statevartable">
State Variables by Shader Type</a> page.</p>

<p class="note">The <i>state</i> data structure (type <code>miState</code>),
and everything else needed to write shaders, is defined in <tt>shader.h</tt>
header file, which must be included by shader source files. It is recommended
to actually use the name <code>state</code> for the state parameter that is
passed as a formal parameter to the function because some macros provided in
the <tt>shader.h</tt> header file rely on this name, for example the
<code>mi_eval_*</code> family of functions.</p>
