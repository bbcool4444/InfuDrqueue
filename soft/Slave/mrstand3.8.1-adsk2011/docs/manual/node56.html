<h2>Accelerated Graphics Hardware Rendering</h2>
<p>
<span class="depr">Deprecated</span> The current solution for hardware
rendering in mental ray has been designed for previous generations of the
GPU, it is not intended to be used for new applications. Future versions of
mental ray will provide enhanced and unified support for hardware acceleration
both for rendering and shading to take full advantage of the capabilities of
modern graphics processors.
<p>
<a id="hardware"></a><a id="INDEX103"></a>
mental ray supports hardware rendering. Hardware shading refers to leveraging
hardware graphics acceleration boards installed in PCs or workstations,
available from vendors such as <b><a id="INDEX104"></a>NVIDIA</b>,
<b><a id="INDEX105"></a>ATI</b>, 3Dlabs, Matrox, SGI, Sun, and others, that
can draw 3D geometry at very high speed. This document uses the
term "hardware" to refer to 3D graphics hardware.</p>
<p>3D graphics hardware is not accessed by programs directly. An
intermediate 3D library is used. Two standards exist:
<b><a id="INDEX106"></a>OpenGL</b> and DirectX, both of which
provide roughly equivalent functionality. However, DirectX is not
portable and available only for Microsoft Windows, while OpenGL is
available for a large range of platforms other than Windows that
are supported by mental ray. Since one of the primary applications
of mental ray is its use in large networks ("render farms") and
such networks almost never use Windows for various technical
reasons, OpenGL was chosen for mental ray to access graphics
hardware.</p>
<p>mental ray versions prior to 3.3 already supported OpenGL
rendering for a limited form of hardware acceleration, primarily
for 3D projection and visibility calculations for rendering and
shadow mapping. The scene was painted using OpenGL, but not with
its true surface colors but pseudo colors that encode addressing
information that tells mental ray for every pixel which object and
which triangle is in front. mental ray then only needs to perform
shading, but not intersection calculations. For actual color
rendering, the visual quality of hardware shading was not
acceptable so this was done in software.</p>
<p>Hardware capabilities have grown significantly since then. It is
now possible to perform hardware shading with a simple form of
procedural shaders. Shaders allow visual effects that go far beyond
the "plastic look" limitations of older designs. It is now becoming
practical to use graphics hardware for actual color shading at very
high speeds without compromising image quality in unacceptable
ways. mental ray 3.3 is designed to implement this new
approach.</p>
