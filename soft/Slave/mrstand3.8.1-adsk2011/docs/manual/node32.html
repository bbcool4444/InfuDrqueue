<h2 id="fo:motionblur">Motion Blur</h2>

<p id="INDEX60">
mental ray can compute motion blur of any animated shading effect,
any movement of scene elements as well as shape deformation.
This includes motion blur of highlights and textured materials as
primary effects, and secondary ray tracing features like shadows,
reflections, <a href="node115.html#INDEX446">refraction</a>s, and
transparency. mental ray provides different motion blur algorithms
to chose from, with different quality and performance impact on the
final rendering.</p>
<p>
There are two methods of defining motion blur:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<dfn id="fo:instancemotion">instance motion</dfn> defines a second
transformation matrix that controls the orientation of the instanced object,
light, or camera at the end of the unit motion interval at time 1.0, in
addition to the regular transformation matrix that defines the orientation
at the beginning of the motion interval at time 0.0, which is typically
identical to camera shutter open time. For cameras, this creates true
curved blurs. Moving lights cause blurred highlights and shadows.</li>
<li>
<dfn id="fo:vectormotion">motion vectors</dfn> can be defined at object
vertices to create internal motion caused by shape changes. Each vertex has
a vector associated with it that describes how far that vertex moves within
the unit motion interval. For deferred objects, where the vertices are created
later during rendering, it is necessary to supply a
<dfn id="INDEX61">motion bounding box</dfn> that describes the lowest and
highest expected motion vector components. Cameras and lights do not allow
<dfn id="INDEX62">motion vector</dfn>s because they have no shape that
could change. mental ray supports <a href="node83.html#INDEX290">motion
path</a>s with up to 15 motion vectors per vertex, to render curved motion
trails for fast moving or deforming objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both instance motion and motion vectors can be combined.</p>
<p>
A <dfn id="INDEX63">shutter</dfn> <var>speed</var> and <var>delay</var>
may be given for the render camera in the scene
<a href="node76.html#opt:shutter">options</a> or on the
<a href="node245.html#shutter">command line</a>. A shutter speed of zero
(the default) will turn motion blur rendering off, regardless of the presence
of <a href="node90.html#INDEX343">motion transform</a>ations or
<a href="node32.html#INDEX62">motion vector</a>s in the scene. The shutter
opens at time <var>delay</var> and closes after the shutter speed time has
elapsed. An object, light, or camera moves by the distance defined by its
motion transformation plus motion vector if the shutter interval is set to
the full motion interval of <var>0.0&hellip;1.0</var>. The motion blur trail
will be rendered shorter for shutter ranges that are smaller than the motion
interval, for example <var>0.2&hellip;0.8</var>, and longer for shutter ranges
exceeding that interval, for example <var>0.0&hellip;2.0</var>. Setting the
shutter open and close times to the same value allows to perform bidirectional
motion blur in output shaders.</p>

<p>mental ray supports motion blur rendering with both the
<a href="node34.html#fo:rasterizer">rasterizer</a>/scanline and raytracing
modes. Depending on the effects used in a rendering and the desired amount
and quality of blurring this gives the choice of fast motion blur rendering
without ray tracing, or very accurate but more expensive motion blur of ray
tracing results like a moving reflection. Both modes can be used together to
achieve a compromise between quality and performance.
Motion blur does introduce rendering overhead, but normally only where blur
must be computed. For example, if the camera moves then motion blur would
need to be computed for the entire image and many if not all objects in the
scene, compared to the movement of a single object where the overhead may be
much smaller.</p>

<p><span class="recent">3.7</span>
Rendering motion blur will soften the details of objects. mental ray can take
advantage of this characteristic by automatically reducing the quality of
view-dependent displacement for moving objects according to the length of the
motion path in screen space within the current shutter interval. This currently
affects any <em>length</em> approximation criteria for displacement of
polygonal or triangle geometry. The decrease of displacement detail has a big
impact on rendering performance and memory consumption by cutting down the
typically huge count of tessellation data noticeably. A motion blur rendering
of a heavy displacement scene may even be tuned to render faster compared to
the static case. The amount of quality reduction in relation to the motion
blur length is controlled by the <dfn>geom displace motion factor</dfn>
<a href="node76.html#geom_displace_motion_factor">scene option</a>. mental ray
enables this feature by default with a reasonable compromise between quality
and speed, but it can be turned off for backwards compatibility.</p>

<p><span class="depr">Deprecated</span>
mental ray supports an alternative motion blur algorithm. While the regular
motion blur algorithm is based on temporal oversampling, and is enabled if the
shutter interval is nonzero (i.e. the shutter time is greater than the shutter
delay time), the <dfn id="INDEX64">fast motion blur</dfn> mode is based on
coordinated spatial and temporal oversampling. This requires much less samples
(typically by a factor of five) for motion blurred pixels. Fast motion blur mode
is enabled if the shutter period is nonzero and the
<a href="node76.html#INDEX185">time contrast</a> is set to 0. In <em>fast motion
blur</em> mode, min samples is forced to be equal to max samples.<br />
Note, that the rasterizer ignores these settings.</p>
