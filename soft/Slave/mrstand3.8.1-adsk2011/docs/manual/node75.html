<h2>Scene Entities</h2>
<p>A .mi file contains commands and scene entities in any order,
with the restriction that an element must be defined before it can
be referenced. All entities are named; all references are done by
name. The following entities can be defined:</p>
<table class="table">
<tr>
<td><code class="mi">options</code></td>
<td>global options</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code class="mi">camera</code></td>
<td>camera: output files, aperture, resolution, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code class="mi">material</code></td>
<td>shading, shadows, volumes, environments, contour, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code class="mi">texture</code></td>
<td>procedural texture or texture image</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code class="mi">light</code></td>
<td>light</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code class="mi">object</code></td>
<td>polygonal or free-form surface geometry</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code class="mi">instance</code></td>
<td>places objects, lights, cameras, and groups in 3D space</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code class="mi">instgroup</code></td>
<td>for grouping instances; the nodes of the <a href="node83.html#INDEX286">scene DAG</a>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code class="mi">assembly</code></td>
<td>demand loaded subscene</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code class="mi">shader</code></td>
<td>optional named shaders</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code class="mi">data</code></td>
<td>arbitrary user data</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code class="mi">lightprofile</code></td>
<td>light profile such as IES or Eulumdat</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>All of these can be defined at any place, as long as they are
not nested (the definition of an element must be completed before
the next element can be defined). All these entities can also be
incrementally changed by introducing the definition with the
<tt>incremental</tt> keyword, which tells mental ray to re-define
an existing element instead of starting a new one. The contents of
the existing element become the defaults for the new one.</p>
<p><tt>options</tt></p>
<p>This element contains rendering <a href="node76.html#INDEX0">options</a>
such as the shadow mode, tracing
depth, sampling algorithm and its parameters, acceleration
algorithm and its parameters, dithering and other modes.</p>
<p><tt>camera</tt></p>
<p>The <a href="node77.html#INDEX226">camera</a> is a description
of the camera characteristics such as focal length and aperture
that determine the field of view.</p>
<p><tt>texture</tt></p>
<p>Textures to apply</p>
<p>2D or 3D color, bump, <a href="node76.html#INDEX200">transparency</a>,</p>
<p>displacement and other maps to objects. Textures are referenced
by other shaders that include the texture in their color or other
computation. Textures may appear verbatim in the file, or may be
read from a texture file, or may be fully procedural, or a
combination of these.</p>
<p><tt>material</tt></p>
<p>Materials describe the</p>
<p>surface properties of objects, volumic properties of the space
enclosed by objects, transparent <a href="node76.html#INDEX197">shadow</a>
casting, <a href="node21.html#INDEX44">environment map</a>ping, and</p>
<p><a href="node21.html#INDEX41">displacement map</a>ping, as well
as a number of property flags.</p>
<p><tt>light</tt></p>
<p>Lights illuminate objects and volumes. Lights are referenced in
materials only (through the light instance), they are not applied
directly to objects.</p>
<p>All lights name a shading function; there are predefined shaders
for points, spots, and directional lights, optionally in
combination with various types of area light sources.</p>
<p><tt>object</tt></p>
<p>Objects describe the actual geometry. Objects may reference
materials to determine the visual appearance of the surface.
Various types of geometry descriptions are supported, such as
<a href="node83.html#INDEX297">polygon</a>al objects and
<a href="node9.html#INDEX13">free-form surface</a>s. By default, all
objects are defined in a local coordinate space
(<a href="node101.html#INDEX369">object space</a>), usually with the origin
at the center of the object. Options exist to switch to
<a href="node101.html#INDEX370">camera space</a> instead.</p>
<p><tt>instance</tt></p>
<p>When an object, light, camera, or instance group is defined, it
does not become part of the scene. It must be placed in 3D space
with an instance, which contains a transformation matrix, inherited
parameters, and several flags. It is possible to have more than one
instance reference the same object, light, camera, or instance
group; this is called "<b><a id="INDEX174"></a>multiple instancing</b>".
The instanced entity then
appears several times in the final processed scene. It is possible
to specify a "<a href="node179.html#INDEX857">geometry shader</a>"
as the instanced item instead of an object. The
"<a href="node179.html#INDEX857">geometry shader</a>" is expected to create
a scene element which is defined in the local coordinate space of
the instance.</p>
<p><tt>instgroup</tt></p>
<p>Instance groups are used to group instances so they can be
instanced as a unit. Instance groups form the nodes of the
<a href="node83.html#INDEX286">scene DAG</a> (Directed Acyclic Graph),
which contains all entities used during processing. The instance
group at the root of the DAG is called the "<b><a name="INDEX175"
id="INDEX175"></a>root instance group</b>." Since instance groups
can themselves be instanced the <a href="node83.html#INDEX286">scene DAG</a>
can be built with any number
of levels and sub-DAGs, each with its own local coordinate space.
<p>
<tt>assembly</tt><p>
Assemblies provide on demand loading of entire subscenes,
containing materials, objects, instances and groups. On demand
loading reduces memory consumption and allows faster rendering
depending on visibility. The subscenes can be defined in separate
files or procedurally.
<p>
<tt>shader</tt><p>
Shaders are user-provided functions used for a variety of purposes.
They are not normally named; they are defined where they are
needed, like in a material. An unnamed shader is also called an
"anonymous shader." The <tt>shader</tt> statement allows giving a
name to a shader; a named shader can be used in any place where an
anonymous shader is expected by giving its name, introduced by an
equals sign.</p>
<p><tt>data</tt></p>
<p><a id="INDEX176"></a> User data blocks are
independent named toplevel scene entities that hold structured or
unstructured data of any kind. Structured data is declared much
like shader parameters, while unstructured data is a raw byte
stream with a fixed size. User data is useful for large amounts of
shared scene data.</p>
<p><tt>lightprofile</tt></p>
<p><a id="INDEX177"></a><a id="INDEX178"></a>
Light profiles such as IES or
Eulumdat are files supplied by lamp vendors that describe the
emission characteristics of physical lights. Light profile blocks
can be defined in the scene file that reference the lamp vendor
profile file, and passed to shaders as parameters of type
<tt>lightprofile</tt>. Shaders can then look up the emission
characteristics of the light.</p>
<p>All scene entities are described in more detail in the following
subsections.</p>
<p>mental ray allows <b><a id="INDEX179"></a>forward references</b>
from groups to instances; and
instances to groups, objects, lights, and cameras. This means that
it is possible to write a group block that names an instance that
does not yet exist, for example; mental ray will resolve the
connection when rendering begins. In all cases not listed above, an
element must exist before it is used. Although forward references
could be used to create cyclic dependencies, this is highly
discouraged because it can lead to inconsistent scene graphs, and
because the <tt>-echo</tt> command-line option cannot properly
resolve such dependencies. Forward referencing is useful for
systems that put together scene files from different sources.</p>
