<h2 id="fo:directlight">Direct Lighting</h2>
<p>
Traditional rendering algorithms are using a fast but approximate solution
to compute illumination in a scene that is based on individual idealized
<a href="#fo:lightsource">light sources</a> which normally don't match the
real-world. mental ray supports these types of lights, along with commonly
used techniques for shadow effects like
<a href="node18.html#fo:shadowmaps">shadow mapping</a>. To overcome the
limitations of the conventional approaches, mental ray provides extensions
towards more physically correct modeling and practical usage, like
<a href="node16.html#fo:arealight">area light sources</a>, or
<a href="node17.html#fo:lightprofile">light profiles</a> which allow to
reproduce the emission properties of manufactured lamps in the renderer.
<p>
Recent developments in high-dynamic-range photography offer a convenient
workflow to illuminate a scene just from images taken in a real-world
environment. mental ray has built-in support for this type of rendering
called <a href="ibl.html#fo:ibl">image-based lighting</a>, and can compute
results of any desired quality which look much more realistic.

<h2 id="fo:lightsource">Light Sources</h2>

<p>A light source illuminates the objects in a scene. Light sources
in mental ray are programmable and consist of a light source name,
a named <a href="node120.html#INDEX471">light shader</a> function,
and an optional origin and direction (at least one of the two must
be present), plus various light-specific parameters such as
shadowmap and photon information. A light profile may also be among
the light-specific parameters. Light shaders accept shader
parameters that depend on the shader.</p>
<p>The <a href="node80.html#INDEX249">light</a>s available in a
scene are defined outside <a href="node79.html#INDEX242">material</a>s.
They may be attached to scene
entities like object instances, or directly referenced inside
materials. Many existing material shaders have a parameter of type
<code class="mi">"light array"</code> that allows referencing a
list of light instances by name. The material shader then applies
the <b><a id="INDEX17"></a>illumination</b> from
these lights to the shaded surface, no matter to which object the
shader is attached to. To implement light-object relations
independent of the actual material the shaders can also obtain a
list of lights associated with the object instance in the scene
description (see <a href="node90.html#light_lists">Light Lists</a>).
<p>
The shading function for light sources may be either a user written
function linked at run time, or it may be one of the generic shaders
coming with mental ray. Applications which integrate mental ray may
provide custom light shaders to define the intended rendering behavior.
<p>
Some shaders accept a boolean parameter <tt>shadow</tt> that
turns shadow casting on or off for that light source, and a
floating point <tt>factor</tt> that is the shadow factor. The
shadow factor controls penetration of opaque objects. The
computation of shadows is a responsibility of
<a href="node120.html#INDEX471">light shader</a>s in mental ray; in order
to compute transparent shadows this may involve the cooperation of
<a href="node121.html#INDEX481">shadow shader</a>s attached to
semi-transparent shadow-casting objects.</p>
<p>For example, the <tt>mib_light_spot</tt> shader in the base
shader library implements a spot light. It has a <tt>color</tt>
parameter that must be set to the color of the light, as three
scalars for the red, green, and blue components. It also allows a
boolean <tt>shadow</tt> parameter that enables shadows cast from
this light if its value is <tt>on</tt>, and a <tt>factor</tt>
parameter that controls shadow penetration, ranging from
<tt>0.0</tt> for black shadows to <tt>1.0</tt> for invisible
shadows. The shader also accepts a boolean <tt>atten</tt> parameter
that turns distance attenuation on or off, and two scalar
parameters <tt>start</tt> and <tt>stop</tt> that specify the range
over which the attenuation falls off if <tt>atten</tt> is
<tt>on</tt>. The spot light mode requires an origin, a direction,
and a spread value in the light definition in the scene description
file. The spread value in the light definition and the
<tt>cone</tt> parameter of the shader together define the spot
characteristics of the light. The <tt>cone</tt> parameter specifies
the angle of the inner solid cone and the spread statement
specifies the outer falloff cone. The spot casts a cone of light
with a softened edge where the intensity falls off to zero between
the cone and spread angles. This and most other shaders specify
angles not in degrees but in the cosine of one-half of the opening
angle to improve performance: 1.0 is an opening angle of 0 degrees
(a laser beam too narrow to see), 0.707 specifies an opening angle
of approximately 90 degrees (because
<span class="math">cos(90&frasl;2)&nbsp;&asymp;&nbsp;0.707</span>) and 0.0
specifies an opening angle of 180 degrees.</p>
