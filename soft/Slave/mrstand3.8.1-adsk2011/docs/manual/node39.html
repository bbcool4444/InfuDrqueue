<h2 id="fo:coverage">Pixel Coverage</h2>
<p>
mental ray supports to compute the <dfn>coverage</dfn> of a pixel
by samples in that pixel. The <a href="node38.html#fo:outdatatype">
data type</a> <tt>"coverage"</tt> can be set for a frame buffer to
enable this feature. All geometry scene elements that are marked
with a non-zero label will be considered for coverage calculation.
<p>
If oversampling is used then mental ray may take several samples
(primary rays) in a pixel for anti-aliasing. The samples are averaged
to produce the final pixel value. At points where one object overlaps
another, one object may account for more of the pixel than the other,
which might just touch a corner of the pixel. In such a case, the coverage
frame buffer specifies exactly how much of the pixel the "more prominent"
object covers. This is a number in the range <var class="num">0.0</var>
(the pixel is empty) to <var class="num">1.0</var> (an object covers the
pixel completely). The detection if samples belong to a certain object is
based on the label value, which can be defined with <tt>tag</tt> statements
in the scene file. The precision of coverage values is bounded by the
number of samples taken, which depends on the
<a href="node76.html#sampling">sampling settings</a>.
<p>
The coverage buffer can be written to a file of scalar format such as
<tt>st</tt>. mental ray also supports to write in a color format by
performing automatic conversion to RGB/A upon storage to such file
formats like TIFF.
<p>
If coverage calculation is enabled by adding the appropriate
<a href="node77.html#mi:framebuffer">frame buffer</a> type, then the depth,
normal, motion, and tag frame buffers, if enabled and left at their default
filtering setting (which is <code>off</code>), are guaranteed to come from
the object that had the most coverage.
