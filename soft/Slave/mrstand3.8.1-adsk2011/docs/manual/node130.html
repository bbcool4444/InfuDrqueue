<h3>Contour Computation</h3>
<p>A regular color image is created by recursively
<a href="node76.html#INDEX181">sampling</a> the scene, that is, casting
rays into the geometry. The same samples are used to generate the
contours. With each sample, some user-specified information is
stored by the user-specified <i>contour store function</i>,
information that is used later for determining the locations,
colors, and widths of the contours. The contour store function is
called right after the material shader and saves information such
as ray intersection point, the normal at the intersection point,
object tag, material color, refraction level, etc.</p>
<p>During recursive sampling, the decision whether to take
additional samples is based on the comparison of two adjacent
samples. New samples are taken if the color contrast is
sufficiently large (as defined by the <tt>contrast</tt> for moving
objects, or if a user-specified <i>contour contrast shader</i>
returns <tt>miTRUE</tt>. The <a href="node40.html#INDEX85">contour
contrast shader</a> can base its decision on any information that
was stored by the contour store function for the two sample points.
For example, the contour contrast function could return
<tt>miTRUE</tt> if their depths or orientations differ much.</p>
<p>When two samples are at minimum distance (according to the value
of the <tt>max samples</tt> parameter), and their contour contrast
is still high (that is, the contour contrast shader returns
<tt>miTRUE</tt>), mental ray assumes that a contour must be drawn
between the two samples and calls a user-specified <i>contour
shader</i>. The contour shader computes the contour color and width
depending on, for example, curvature (orientation difference), Z
depth, Z depth difference, material color, or some other
information saved by the contour store shader. The contour shader
of the object closest to the camera is used. If no contour shader
is specified for the material, it does not get a contour. The
computed contour point data (contour color, width, etc.) for each
point on the contour is stored in a temporary data structure.
mental ray merges these contour points into straight contour line
segments, each represented by its two endpoints.</p>
<p>These contour line segments are received by a contour output
shader in a postprocessing step. The contour output shader reads
the contour segment endpoints and generates, for example, an image
or a PostScript file.</p>
<p>Contour rendering is not compatible with the rasterizer.</p>
