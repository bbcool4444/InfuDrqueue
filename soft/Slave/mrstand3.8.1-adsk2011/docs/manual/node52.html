<h2 id="fo:finalgather">Final Gathering</h2>

<p><dfn id="INDEX98" id="finalgather">Final gathering</dfn> is a
technique for estimating global illumination for a given point by
either sampling a number of directions in the hemisphere over that
point (such a sample set is called a <dfn>final gather point</dfn>),
or by averaging a number of final gather points nearby since final
gather points are too expensive to compute for every illuminated
point.</p>
<p>For diffuse scenes, final gathering often improves the quality
of the global illumination solution. Without final gathering, the
global illumination on a diffuse surface is computed by estimating
the photon density (and energy) near that point. With final
gathering, many new rays are sent out to sample the hemisphere
above the point to determine the incident illumination. Some of
these rays hit diffuse surfaces; the global illumination at those
points is then computed by the material shaders at those sample
point, using illumination from the globillum
<a href="node48.html#INDEX96">photon map</a> if available and other
material properties. Other rays hit specular surfaces and do not
contribute to the final gather color (since that type of light
transport is a secondary caustic). Tracing many rays (each with a
<a href="node48.html#INDEX96">photon map</a> lookup) is very
time-consuming so it is only done when necessary - in most cases,
interpolation and extrapolation from previous nearby final
gatherings is sufficient.</p>
<p>Final gathering is useful in scenes where the indirect
illumination various slowly, such as purely diffuse scenes. For
such scenes, final gathering eliminates
<a href="node48.html#INDEX96">photon map</a> artifacts such as low
frequency noise and dark corners. Fewer photons are needed in the
globillum <a href="node48.html#INDEX96">photon map</a> and lower
globillum accuracy is sufficient since each final gather averages
over many values of <a href="node80.html#INDEX259">indirect
illumination</a>.
<p>In film production work, final gathering is often used rather
than photon mapping, except for caustics. Final gathering by
default supports a single bounce only. Multiple-bounce effects tend
to have far less impact on the final image than the first bounce;
these are performed by photons by default and by final gathering
only if the shaders adjusts the <a href="node76.html#INDEX196">trace
depth</a>. Although physical correctness is lost, this is often
"good enough" for film production, and final gathering is easier to
control than photons emanating from distant light sources. However,
for accurate indoor illumination simulations and other CAD-related
applications, photon mapping is preferred.</p>
<p>Final gathering is set <tt>off</tt> by default, but can be
turned <tt>on</tt> in the options. To change the number of rays
shot in each final gather (and optionally the maximum distance at
which a final gathering result can be used for interpolation and
the minimum distance at which it must be used), specify a
<tt>finalgather accuracy</tt> setting in the options. For
example,</p>
<pre>
finalgather accuracy 1000 1.5 0.25
</pre>
<p>increases the number of rays and reduces noise in scenes with
complex illumination and geometry. The default number of rays is
1000. The default maximum distance depends on the scene extent;
decreasing it will reduce noise but increase render time. The
default minimum distance is 10% of the maximum distance.</p>
<p>
mental ray 3.4 has changed the final gathering algorithm. It normally
achieves better quality in less time with approximately one-half the
number of rays. It is necessary to modify the accuracy settings though,
for example changing 1000 to 500 in the preceding example, or rendering
times will increase.</p>
<p>
<span class="new">3.8</span> Final gathering can be combined with importance-based techniques like
<a href="importons.html#fo:importons">Importons</a> and
<a href="irradparticles.html#fo:ip">Irradiance Particles</a>, to achieve
better quality with less artifacts in shorter rendering time. In these
cases, importons are shot before FG, which are then used to control the
distribution of FG rays according to "importance".

<h3 id="fo:fg_modes">Final Gathering Modes</h3>

<p>mental ray offers the following final gathering modes:</p>
<dl>
<dt id="mi:fg_automatic">"automatic"</dt>
<dd>This final gathering mode offers greatly simplified usage compared to
version 3.4. It no longer requires radii to control final gathering sampling
and interpolation. The parameters used to control this mode are:
<ul>
<li>number of finalgather rays (the first numeric argument of "finalgather
accuracy"),
<li>"finalgather points", the approximate number of points used for
the interpolation.
</ul>
</dd>

<dt id="mi:fg_multiframe">"multiframe"</dt>
<dd>This mode is similar to the <a href="#mi:fg_automatic">"automatic"</a>
mode, but has been specifically designed for rendering of camera
fly-through animations. To avoid flickering, the rendering should be split
into two parts. In the first part, the final gather map is rendered for the
set of key frames or for a coarse sequence of frames. In the second part,
the frozen final gathering mode is used for the rendering of the full
animation. It is possible that some part of the scene will not contain
sufficient number of finalgather points for some frames not belonging to
the key frame set. To avoid picking up illumination from distant objects
which is possible in the <a href="#mi:fg_automatic">automatic</a> mode,
the finalgather accuracy max radius limits the maximal distance. If a
sufficient number of final gather points is not found within that distance,
the illumination will be faded to black smoothly.
<dd>
This mode is typically useful for animated scenes, but is not necessarily
the best method for animations where flickering is not a problem. It may
also be well suitable for still images without animation.
The parameters used to control this mode are:
<ul>
<li>number of finalgather rays (the first numeric argument of "finalgather
accuracy"),
<li>min and max radius (secondary arguments of "finalgather accuracy"),
<li>optional "view" flag of the finalgather accuracy,
<li>"finalgather points", the approximate number of points used for
the interpolation.
</ul>
</dd>
<dt id="mi:fg_34">"3.4"</dt>
<dd>This mode is provided for compatibility with mental ray version 3.4
settings, which gives the experienced user additional control over the final
gathering computations. It renders results similar to the older version of
mental ray but benefits from improvements of the current implementation.
It and makes use of all "finalgather accuracy" arguments (optional
"view" flag, number of finalgather rays, max and min radii).</dd>

<dt id="mi:fg_strict34">"strict 3.4"</dt>
<dd>This mode is similar to the <a href="#mi:fg_34">"3.4"</a> mode, but
achieves higher compatibility with the older mental ray version, allowing
identical re-rendering of old scenes with the current mental ray. Some
rendering improvements are disabled in that mode.</dd>

<dt>"force" </dt>
<dd>This mode disables the final gather point cache at all, and will always
compute the accurate solution. This takes time but will yield superior results.
</dl>

<p>The mode can be selected by a
<a href="node76.html#finalgathering">scene option</a> or on the
mental ray <a href="node245.html#cli:fg">command line</a>.
<br />The default is "3.4" compatibility mode.</p>
