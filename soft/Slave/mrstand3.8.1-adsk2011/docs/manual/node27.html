<h2 id="fo:shaders">User-Defined Shaders</h2>

<p>mental ray comes with several of standard shader packages which
allow to render a big variety of visual effects. In addition,
user-defined shaders can be written and used for rendering. They are
traditionally written in native computer languages like C or C++ and
manually compiled and linked at runtime, or the source code can be
passed to mental ray for automatic compilation and dynamic loading.
Modern approaches may use the <em>meta</em> shading language
<dfn>MetaSL</dfn> to write code in a standardized form which abstracts
from specific renderers. <a href="#fo:metasl">MetaSL shaders</a> including
phenomena built on top if such shaders are directly supported by mental ray.
<p>
User-defined shaders can be used in place of any standard shader,
redefining materials, textures, lights, environments, volumes,
displacements and more.

<h3 id="fo:metasl">MetaSL Shaders <span class="recent">3.7</span></h3>
<p>
mental ray supports shaders written in <dfn>MetaSL</dfn> language to be
used for software rendering. This is handled by integrated support for
automatic compilation and/or linking of <a href="node99.html#sh:metasl">
MetaSL shaders</a> on the target platform. For network rendering,
compilation of the MetaSL shaders on slave or satellites is supported.
</p>

<h3 id="fo:native">Native Shaders</h3>
<p>
The mental ray native shader interface uses C language conventions.
Shaders written in C++ should use <tt>extern "C"</tt> constructs to access
the interface. Care should be taken to to avoid known C++ performance
pitfalls such as <tt>new</tt> or virtual class members. Even a small
runtime overhead becomes significant if incurred millions of times per
frame.</p>
<p>mental ray can link in user-defined shaders either as dynamic shared
object (<b id="INDEX53">DSO</b> or <b id="INDEX54">DLL</b>, as plain
object file, or in source form.</p>
<p>Every user-defined shader must be declared before it can be
used. A declaration is a statement that names the shader, and lists
the name and type of all its parameters.</p>
<p>Declarations may appear in the <tt>.mi</tt> scene description
file, but are typically stored in an external file included at run
time. Note that all <tt>code</tt> and <tt>link</tt> statements must
precede the first declaration in the <tt>.mi</tt> file.</p>
<p>Available parameter types are boolean, integer, scalar, string,
color (RGBA), vector, transform (4&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;4 matrix),
scalar texture, color texture, vector texture, shader, material,
geometry, and light. In addition to these primitive types, compound
types may be built using struct and array declarations. Structs may
be nested but arrays may not.</p>
<p>An instance of a shader can be created by creating a material,
texture, light etc. that names a declared shader and associates a
parameter list with values. Any parameter name that appeared in the
declaration can be omitted or listed in any order, followed by a
value that depends on the parameter type. Omitted parameters
default to 0. Scalars accept floating point numbers, vectors accept
one to three floating point numbers, and textures accept a texture
name.</p>
<p>After a material, texture, light etc has been created, it can be
used. Materials are used by giving their names in object geometry
statements, and textures and lights are used by naming them as
parameter values in other shaders, typically material shaders.</p>
<p>When the C function that implements a user-defined shader is
called, it receives three pointers: one points to the result, one
to global state, and one to a data structure that contains the
parameter values. mental ray stores the parameter values in that
data structure using a layout that corresponds exactly to the
layout a C compiler would create, so that the C function can access
parameters simply by dereferencing the pointer and accessing the
data structure members by name. For this, it is necessary that a
struct declaration is available in C syntax that corresponds
exactly to the declaration in <tt>.mi</tt> syntax.</p>
