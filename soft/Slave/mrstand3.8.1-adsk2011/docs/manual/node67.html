<h2>Shader Graphs</h2>
<p><a id="INDEX147"></a><a id="INDEX148"></a>
Instead of assigning a constant value to a parameter in a shader definition,
it is possible to assign a shader:</p>
<pre>
    "<i>parameter_name</i>" = "<i>shader_name</i>"  
</pre>
<p>For parameters assigned in this way, no value is stored in the
shader definition. It is obtained by calling <i>shader_name</i> at
runtime. For example, if the <i>ambient</i> parameter of a material
shader has the constant value <tt>1 0 0</tt>, it is always red, but
if another shader is assigned to it that other shader is called
when the material shader asks for the value using the
<i><a href="node138.html#INDEX522">mi_eval</a></i> function or one of its
derivatives. The other shader could be a texture shader, for
example, resulting in a textured ambient value.</p>
<p>The return type of the assigned shader must agree with the
parameter type. If the return type of the assigned shader is
<tt>struct</tt>, it is possible to select a structure member by
appending a period and the name of the struct member to the shader
name. Consider the following assignment:</p>
<a id="assignex"></a>
<pre>
     declare shader
        color "phong" (color "ambient",
                       color "diffuse",
                       color "specular")
        version 1
     end declare

     declare shader
        struct {color "a", color "b"}
              "texture" (color texture "picture")
        version 1
     end declare

     color texture "fluffy" "/tmp/image.rgb"

     shader "map" "texture" (
        "picture"   "fluffy")

     shader "mtlsh" "phong" (
        "ambient"   0.3 0.3 0.3,
        "diffuse"   = "map.a",
        "specular"  = "map.b")
</pre>
<p>This defines a material shader that does not support texturing
in any way because it has no parameters of type <tt>shader</tt> or
<tt>color texture</tt>. Yet, shader assignments allow its diffuse
and specular components to be textured without the <tt>phong</tt>
shader being aware of it. Whenever <tt>phong</tt> accesses its
ambient parameter value by calling
<i><a href="node138.html#INDEX522">mi_eval</a></i>, it gets a constant color
0.3 0.3 0.3. When it accesses its diffuse or specular color, a call
to the named shader <tt>map</tt> results (which actually calls
shader <tt>texture</tt>), whose result is then returned to the
<tt>phong</tt> shader.</p>
<p>In this example, the <tt>map</tt> shader returns two colors
<tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>, which are selected in the shader
assignment by appending <tt>.a</tt> and <tt>.b</tt> to
<tt>map</tt>. (For this reason periods should be avoided in
parameter names.) If the shader had returned only a single color,
only <tt>"map"</tt> would have been assigned, without appending a
period and a structure member name.</p>
<p>In the example, <tt>map</tt> is assigned twice. Obviously it is
not desirable to actually call it twice, because the first call
will already have set both its <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> return
values. After the first call from a shader, mental ray caches the
return value to avoid further calls. As soon as the shader
<tt>phong</tt> returns, the cache is discarded to ensure that the
next call to <tt>phong</tt>, most likely with a different state,
calls <tt>map</tt> instead of using a stale cache.</p>
<p>Note that shaders that support <a href="node67.html#INDEX148">shader
graph</a>s must use the <i><a href="node138.html#INDEX522">mi_eval</a></i>
function to access their
parameters. This was done to ensure that only those assigned
shaders whose values are actually used are evaluated. For example,
a material shader that has two color parameters, one for the front
and one for the back side of the surface, will access only one of
its parameters by using <i><a href="node138.html#INDEX522">mi_eval</a></i>
only once.</p>
<p>To see how the <i>phong</i> shader is implemented as a C shader,
see section <a href="node113.html#paramassign">paramassign</a>.</p>
<p>The advantage of shader assignment is that it is not necessary
to write shaders to accept procedural values. Without shader
assignments, a simple Phong material shader would need parameters
of type <tt>shader</tt> or <i>color texture</i> in addition to the
standard ambient, diffuse, and specular parameters. Shader
assignment allows writing small, reusable
"<a href="node19.html#INDEX34">base shader</a>s" that can be easily combined
into powerful <a href="node67.html#INDEX148">shader graph</a>s,
instead of writing large monolithic shaders that are hard to modify
and inflexible to use.</p>
<p>The third form of parameter assigning using the
<tt>interface</tt> keyword is available only inside phenomena,
which will be discussed next.</p>
