<h2>Volume Shaders</h2>
<p><a id="INDEX460"></a> Volume shaders may be
attached to the camera or to a material. They modify the color
returned from an intersection point to account for the distance the
ray traveled through a volume. The most common application for
volume<a id="INDEX461"></a><a id="INDEX462"></a> shaders is atmospheric
fog effects; for example, a
simple volume shader may simulate fog by fading the input color to
white depending on the ray distance. By definition, the distance
<i>dist</i> given in the state is 0.0 and the intersection
<i>point</i> is undefined if the ray has infinite length.</p>
<p>Volume shaders are normally called in three situations. When a
material shader returns, the volume shader that the material shader
left in the <i>state</i>&rarr;volume variable is called, without
copying the state, as if it had been called as the last operation
of the material shader. Copying the state is not necessary because
the volume shader does not return to the material shader, so it is
not necessary to preserve any variables in the state.</p>
<p><a id="INDEX463"></a> Unless the <tt>shadow
segment</tt> mode is in effect, volume shaders are also called when
a light shader has returned; in this case the volume shader
<i>state</i>&rarr;volume is called once for the entire distance
from the light source to the illuminated point (i.e., to the point
that caused the material shader that sampled the light to be
called). In <tt>shadow segment</tt> mode, volume shaders are not
called for <a href="node117.html#INDEX463">light ray</a>s but for
every shadow ray segment from the illuminated point towards the
light source. Some volume shaders may decide that they should not
apply to <a href="node117.html#INDEX463">light ray</a>s; this can
be done by returning immediately if the <i>state</i>&rarr;type
variable is <tt>miRAY_LIGHT</tt>.</p>
<p>Finally, volume shaders are called after an <a href="node119.html#INDEX468">environment shader</a> was called. Note
that if a volume shader is called after the material, light, or
other shader, the return value of that other shader is discarded
and the return value of the volume shader is used. The reason is
that a volume shader can substitute a non-black color even if the
original shader has given up. Volume shaders return
<tt>miFALSE</tt> if no light can pass through the given volume, and
<tt>miTRUE</tt> if there is a non-black result color.</p>
<p>Material shaders have two separate state variables dealing with
volumes, <i>volume</i> and <i>refraction_volume</i>. If the
material shader casts a refraction or transparency ray, the tracing
function will copy the refraction volume shader, if there is one,
to the volume shader after copying the state. This means that the
next intersection point finds the refraction volume in
<i>state</i>&rarr;volume, which effectively means that once the ray
has entered an object, that object's interior volume shader is
used. However, the material shader is responsible to detect when a
refraction ray exits an object, and overwrite
<i>state</i>&rarr;refraction_volume with an appropriate outside
volume shader, such as <i>state</i>&rarr;camera<i>&rarr;</i>volume,
or a volume shader found by following the <i>state</i>&rarr;parent
links.</p>
<p>Since volume shaders modify a color calculated by a previous
material shader, environment shader, or light shader, they differ
from these shaders in that they receive an input color in the
<i>result</i> argument that they are expected to modify. A very
simple fog volume shader could be written as:</p>
<p><a id="INDEX464"></a></p>
<pre>
    miBoolean myfog(
        register miColor      *result,
        register miState      *state,
        register struct myfog *paras)
    {
        register miScalar     fade;
        register miColor      *fogcolor;
        register miScalar     max;

        if (state-&gt;type == miRAY_LIGHT)
             return(miTRUE);

        max      = *mi_eval_scalar(&amp;paras-&gt;maxdist);
        fogcolor =  mi_eval_scalar(&amp;paras-&gt;fogcolor);
        fade     = state-&gt;dist &gt; max ? 1.0
                                     : state-&gt;dist / max;

        result-&gt;r = fade     * fogcolor-&gt;r
                  + (1-fade) * result-&gt;r;
        result-&gt;g = fade     * fogcolor-&gt;g
                  + (1-fade) * result-&gt;g;
        result-&gt;b = fade     * fogcolor-&gt;b
                  + (1-fade) * result-&gt;b;
        result-&gt;a = fade     * fogcolor-&gt;a
                  + (1-fade) * result-&gt;a;

        return(miTRUE);
    }
</pre>
<p>This shader linearly fades the input color to
<i>state</i>&rarr;fogcolor (probably white) within
<i>state</i>&rarr;maxdist internal space units. Objects more
distant are completely lost in <a href="node117.html#INDEX461">fog</a>. The length of the ray to be
modified can be found in <i>state</i>&rarr;dist, its start point in
<i>state</i>&rarr;org, and its end point in
<i>state</i>&rarr;point. This example shader does not apply to
<a href="node117.html#INDEX463">light ray</a>s, light sources can
penetrate fog of any depth because of the <tt>miRAY_LIGHT</tt>
check. In this case, the shader returns <tt>miTRUE</tt> anyway
because the shader did not fail; it merely decided not to apply
fog. Note that the shader parameters are evaluated with <i><a href="node138.html#INDEX522">mi_eval</a></i> after the <i>if</i>
statement to ensure that no unnecessary work is done by obtaining
parameter values that are not going to be used.</p>
<p>If this shader is attached to the camera, the atmosphere
surrounding the scene will contain fog. Every
<i>state</i>&rarr;volume will inherit this camera volume shader,
until a refraction or transparency ray is cast. The ray will copy
the material's volume shader, <i>state</i>&rarr;refraction_volume,
if there is one, to <i>state</i>&rarr;volume, and the ray is now
assumed to be in the object. If the material has no volume shader
to be copied, the old <a href="node117.html#INDEX460">volume
shader</a> will remain in place and will be inherited by subsequent
rays.</p>
<p>Some volume shaders employ <a href="node140.html#INDEX556">ray
marching</a> techniques to sample lights from empty space, to
achieve effects such as visible light beams. Before such a shader
calls <i><a href="node140.html#INDEX555">mi_sample_light</a></i>,
it should store 0 in <i>state</i>&rarr;pri to inform mental ray
that there is no primitive to illuminate, and to not attempt
certain optimizations such as backface elimination. Shaders other
than volume shaders may do this too, but must restore <i>pri</i>
before returning. Some <i><a href="miquery.html#api:mi_query">mi_query</a></i> modes do not work if
<i>pri</i> has been modified.</p>
<p>Volume shader that sample light sources should not only clear
<i>state</i>&rarr;pri but also use this test at the beginning:</p>
<pre>
    if (state-&gt;type == miRAY_LIGHT) return(miTRUE);
</pre>
<p>Since sampling a light causes one or more
<a href="node117.html#INDEX463">light ray</a>s to be cast, and since these
<a href="node117.html#INDEX463">light ray</a>s most likely travel
through the same volume, they would also call this same volume
shader recursively. If the volume shader doesn't realize this and
proceeds to cast even more recursive rays, it will get into an
infinite recursion until a stack overflow aborts the program. Note
that the test should come before all other code, especially
<i>mi_eval</i> calls, to avoid unnecessary work and increase
performance.</p>
