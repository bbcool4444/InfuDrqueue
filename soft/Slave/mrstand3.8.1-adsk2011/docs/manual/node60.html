<h1>Scene Description Language</h1>

<p><a id="scenechapter"></a> <a id="INDEX107"></a> <a id="INDEX108"></a>
<a id="INDEX109"></a> The mental images scene description language
allows reading a scene from an ASCII or binary file called the <tt>.mi</tt>
file. It contains a list of commands and scene entities. Commands are
instructions for the renderer, for example to set options such as verbosity,
or to link external libraries and shader packages. Scene entities describe
the properties and relations of geometrical objects, light sources, cameras,
materials and other components, 
 which and shaders and other components.</p>
<p>Animations are rendered by setting up the first frame and rendering it,
followed by scene modifications and another render command for every successive
frame. These scene modifications are
called <b><a id="INDEX110"></a>incremental change</b>s.</p>
<p>The recommended file extension is <tt>.mi</tt>.</p>
<p>This section discusses the parts that make up an <tt>.mi</tt> file.

<h3>Conventions</h3>
<p>
The following type-setting conventions and special symbols are used in
scene language or command line fragments:
<dl>
<dt>Regular<dd>is used for explanations.
<dt><code>Literal</code><dd>denotes scene language or command line fragments
that should be entered verbatim, as shown.
<dt><var>Variable</var><dd>denotes variable items that stand for certain
application dependent text or other insertions described in the explanation.
</dl>
<dl compact>
<dt><dfn>|</dfn><dd>the vertical bar separates alternatives
( "<code>x <dfn>|</dfn> y</code>" means "either <code>x</code> or <code>y</code>" ).
<dt><dfn>&hellip;</dfn><dd>an ellipsis denotes repetition.
( "<code>x <dfn>...</dfn></code>" means "<code>x</code>, or <code>x x</code>, or
<code>x x x</code>, ..." ).
<dt><dfn>[ ]</dfn><dd>optional parts are enclosed in tall square brackets (
"<code>x <dfn>[</dfn> y <dfn>]</dfn></code>" means "either <code>x</code>, or
<code>x</code> followed by <code>y</code>" ).
</dl>
<p>
<b>Strings</b> are quoted with double quotes; this includes all names.
mental ray permits strings containing literal double quotes if they are
prefixed with a backslash. Names, such as material, light, or object names,
need not be quoted, but it is highly recommended to avoid conflicts with
reserved words <a href="#FOOTNOTE8">[8]</a>, and to allow
non-alphabetic characters. Without quotes, only lowercase and
uppercase letters, underscores, and digits may be used; a digit may
not be the first character of an unquoted name. No such
restrictions apply to quoted names.</p>

<p><b>Integers</b> are distinguished from floating-point numbers by
appending the suffix <b>int</b>, as in <tt>degree<sub>int</sub></tt>.
Integers are an optional "<code>+</code>" or "<code>&minus;</code>"
sign followed by a sequence of digits "<code>0</code>" through
"<code>9</code>".
<p>
<b>Floating-point</b> numbers follow the same rules, but may optionally
contain a decimal point "<code>.</code>" and an optional exponent. If the number
begins with a decimal point, a leading zero is assumed. Exponential
notation has the form "<var>n</var><code>e</code><var>m</var>",
which is interpreted as <i>n * 10<sup>m</sup></i>. Strings can be
distinguished from numbers because the grammar always requires them
to be enclosed in double quotes.</p>
<p>
<b><a id="INDEX111"></a>Comments</b> are introduced
with the "<code>#</code>" character, unless quoted, and except between
<tt>$code</tt> and <tt>$end code</tt>. Comments extend to the end
of the line.</p>
<p>Unquoted <b><a id="INDEX112"></a>whitespace</b>
acts as a separator but is otherwise ignored. Line breaks and
indentation have no syntactical relevance, except where otherwise
noted (<a href="node71.html#INDEX156">command</a>s beginning with a
dollar sign, for example, must appear at the beginning of the
line).</p>
<p>By convention, the first line of any .mi file should begin with
the three characters <tt>#mi</tt>, followed by a blank (not a tab),
followed by the partial or full version number of the earliest
required mental ray version number. For the syntax described in
this manual this is <tt>3.6</tt> or higher. This comment serves as a
"magic number" that helps interactive programs or utilities like
<tt>file</tt> to decide whether this is a .mi file or something
else. It is not parsed by mental ray itself.</p>
<p><a id="FOOTNOTE8">[8]</a> Future versions may
reserve more words than described here.<br /></p>
