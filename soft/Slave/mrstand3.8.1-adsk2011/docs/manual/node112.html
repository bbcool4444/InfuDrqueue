<h2>Shader Parameter Declarations</h2>
<p><a id="INDEX417"></a> In addition to the state
variables that are provided by mental ray and are shared by all
shaders, every shader has <i>shader parameters</i>. In the .mi
scene file, shader references look much like a function call: the
shader name is given along with a list of parameters. Every shader
call may have a different list of parameters. mental ray does not
restrict or predefine the number and types of shader parameters,
any kind of information may be passed to the shader. Typical
examples for shader parameters are ambient, diffuse, and specular
colors for material shaders, attenuation parameters for light
shaders, and so on. An empty parameter list in a shader call (as
opposed to a shader declaration) has a special meaning; see the
note at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p>In this manual, the term "<b><a id="INDEX418"></a>parameter</b>s" refers to shader parameters in the
.mi scene file; the term "arguments" is used for arguments to C
functions.</p>
<p>Shaders need both state variables and shader parameters.
Generally, variables that are computed by mental ray, or whose
interpretation is otherwise known to mental ray, and that are
useful to different types or instances of shaders are found in
state variables. Variables that are specific to a shader, and that
may change for each instance of the shader, are found in shader
parameters. mental ray does not access or compute shader parameters
in any way, it merely passes them from the .mi file to the shader
when it is invoked.</p>
<p><a id="INDEX419"></a><a id="INDEX420"></a><a id="shaderdecl"></a>
To interpret these parameters in the .mi file, mental ray needs a
declaration of parameter names and types that is equivalent to the
C struct that the shader later uses to access the parameters. The
declaration in the .mi file must be exactly equivalent to the C
struct, or the shader will mis-interpret the parameter data
structure constructed by mental ray. (Using the <a href="node164.html#INDEX841">mkmishader</a> utility ensures that both
declarations agree, see section <a href="node164.html#mkmishader">mkmishader</a>.) This means that three
parts are needed to write a shader: the .mi declaration, the C
parameter struct, and the C source of the shader. The .mi
declaration is normally stored in a separate file that is included
into the .mi scene file using a <tt>$include</tt> statement.</p>
<p>The syntax of .mi shader declarations is fully described in
section <a href="node112.html#declaration">declaration</a>. Here,
only a brief overview is given. Shaders must be declared with
shader name, return type, and the types and names of all
parameters. Options such as the shader version may be specified
also:</p>
<pre>
    declare shader  
        [ <i>type</i> ] "<i>shader_name</i>" (  
            <i>type</i> "<i>parameter_name</i>",  
            <i>type</i> "<i>parameter_name</i>",  
            ...  
            <i>type</i> "<i>parameter_name</i>"  
        )  
        [ version <i>version</i><sub>int</sub> ]  
        [ <i>options</i> ]  
    end declare  
</pre>
<p><a id="INDEX421"></a> For example, a simple
material shader containing ambient, diffuse, and specular colors,
transparency, an optional array of bump map textures, and an array
of lights could be declared in the .mi file as:</p>
<pre>
    declare shader  
        color "my_material" (  
            color "ambient",  
            color "diffuse",  
            color "specular",  
            scalar "shiny",  
            scalar "reflect",  
            scalar "transparency",  
            scalar "ior",  
            vector texture "bump",  
            array light "lights"  
        )  
        version 1  
    end declare  
</pre>
<p>If there is only one array, there is a small efficiency
advantage in listing it last. It is recommended that the largest
array (arrays of large structs are larger than arrays of
primitives) is given as the last parameter. The material shader
declared in this example can be used in a <tt>material</tt>
statement like this:</p>
<pre>
    material "mat1"  
        "my_material" (  
            "specular" 1.0 1.0 1.0,  
            "ambient" 0.3 0.3 0.0,  
            "diffuse" 0.7 0.7 0.0,  
            "shiny" 50.0,  
            "bump" "tex1",  
            "lights"[ "light1", "light2","light3" ],  
            "reflect" 0.5  
        )  
    end material  
</pre>
<p>Note that the parameters can be defined in any order that does
not have to agree with the order in the declaration, and that
parameters can be omitted. Omitted parameters default to 0. This
example assumes that the texture <tt>tex1</tt> and the three lights
have been defined prior to this material definition. Again, be sure
to use the names of the textures and lights, not the names of the
texture and light shaders. All names in the above two examples were
written as strings enclosed in double quotes to disambiguate names
from reserved keywords, and to allow special characters in the
names that would otherwise be illegal.</p>
<p>When choosing names, avoid double colons and periods, which have
a special meaning when accessing structured shader return values
and interface parameters in phenomenon subshaders.</p>
<p><a id="INDEX422"></a> When the shader
<tt>my_material</tt> is called, its third argument will be a
pointer to a data structure built by mental ray from the
declaration and the actual parameters in the .mi file. In order for
the C source of the shader to access the parameters, it needs an
equivalent declaration in C syntax that must agree exactly with the
.mi declaration. The type names can be translated according to the
following table:</p>
<p><a id="INDEX423"></a></p>

</div>
<p>A <b><a id="INDEX424"></a>light group</b> is an
<a href="node91.html#INDEX350">instance group</a> that contains
instances of lights. For the purpose of shading, the group is
treated as if it were a single light.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended to use the same parameter names in
the C declaration as in the .mi declaration. Also, structures in
either declaration should be reflected in the other, even if not
enclosed in arrays, to ensure that mental ray inserts the same
padding as the C compiler.</p>
<p>Arrays are more complicated than the types in this table because
the size of the <b><a id="INDEX425"></a>array</b>
is not known at declaration time. The C declaration of an array
consists of a start index prefixed with <tt>i_</tt>, the size of
the array prefixed with <tt>n_</tt>, and the array itself, declared
as an array with one element. mental ray will allocate the
structure as large as required by the actual array size at call
time. To access array element <i>i</i> in the range <span class="math">0&hellip;n_array&minus;1</span>, the C expression
<code>array[i_array&thinsp;+&thinsp;i]</code> must be used. This
expression allows mental ray to store the shader parameters in
virtual shared memory regardless of the base address of the shader
parameter structure, which is different on every machine on the
network.</p>
<p>Here is the C structure for the above example .mi
declaration:</p>
<pre>
    struct my_material {
        miColor  ambient;
        miColor  diffuse;
        miColor  specular;
        miScalar shiny;
        miScalar reflect;
        miScalar transparency;
        miScalar ior;
        miTag    bump;
        int      i_lights;
        int      n_lights;
        miTag    lights[1];
        };
</pre>
<p>Note that here the order of structure members must match the
order in the .mi declaration exactly. For example, suppose a shader
has a .mi declaration containing an <b><a id="INDEX426"></a>array</b> of integers:</p>
<pre>
     declare shader
         color "myshader" ( array integer "list" )
         version 1
     end declare
</pre>
<p>The C declaration for the shader's parameters is:</p>
<pre>
     struct myshader {
          int       i_list;
          int       n_list;
          miInteger list[1];
          };
</pre>
<p>A shader that needs to operate on this array, for example
printing all the array elements to stdout, would use a loop like
this:</p>
<pre>
     int *list  =  mi_eval_integer(paras-&gt;list);
     int i_list = *mi_eval_integer(&amp;paras-&gt;i_list);
     int n_list = *mi_eval_integer(&amp;paras-&gt;n_list);
     int i;
     for (i=0; i &lt; n_list; i++)
          mi_info("%d", list[i_list + i]);
</pre>
<p>assuming that <tt>paras</tt> is the third shader argument and
has type <tt>struct myshader *</tt>. The use of the <tt>i_list</tt>
parameter may seem strange to C programmers, who may wish to hide
it in a macro like</p>
<pre>
     #define EL(array,nel) array[i_##array + nel]
</pre>
<p>This macro requires an ANSI C preprocessor; K&amp;R
preprocessors do not support the <tt>##</tt> notation and should
use <tt>/**/</tt> instead. This macro is not predefined in
shader.h. The reason for this peculiar way of accessing arrays is
improved performance. The <b><a id="INDEX427"></a>array</b> <tt>list[1]</tt> has space for only one
element, because the actual number of array elements depends on the
shader instance in the .mi file, which may list an arbitrary number
of elements. Since mental ray is based on a <b><a name="INDEX428"
id="INDEX428"></a>virtual shared database</b> that moves pieces of
data such as shader parameters transparently from one machine to
another, no such piece of data may contain a pointer. Pointers
would not be valid in another machine's virtual address space.
Adjusting the pointer on the other machine is impractical because
it would significantly reduce performance for some scenes, and
would require knowledge of the structure layout for finding the
pointers that may not be available in versions of mental ray not
based on a .mi front-end parser. Therefore, the array is appended
to the parameter structure, so the entire block can be moved to
another machine in a single network transfer. It is safe to access
the first element of the array, because space for it is always
allocated by declarations such as <tt>list[1]</tt>, but the second
is a problem because in a C declaration like</p>
<pre>
     struct myshader {
          int       i_list;
          int       n_list;
          miInteger list[1];
          miScalar  factor;
          miBoolean bool;
          };
</pre>
<p>the second element, <tt>list[1]</tt>, occupies the same address
as <tt>factor</tt>, and the third overlays <tt>bool</tt>. The
situation becomes more complex for arrays of structures. The
solution is to put the value of the first element after the last
"regular" shader parameter, <tt>bool</tt> in this example, followed
by the other element values. This means that the first few C array
elements that overlay other parameters must be skipped. The
<tt>i_</tt> variable tells the shader exactly how many. In the
example, <tt>i_list</tt> would be 3. Assuming the following shader
instance, used as part of a material, texture, or some other
definition requiring a shader call:</p>
<pre>
     "myshader" (
          "factor" 1.4142136,
          "list"   [ 42, 123, 486921, 777 ],
          "bool"   on
          )
</pre>
<p>mental ray would arrange the values in memory like this:</p>
<div class="pic"><img style="width:60%" src="images/array.jpg" /></div>
<p>On multithreaded machines, it is possible that any given shader
runs in multiple threads simultaneously. When this happens, they
share all static variables defined in the sources, all shader
parameters, and the <a href="node159.html#INDEX837">user
pointer</a>. The only things that are separate in separate threads
are "auto" variables on the stack, and the state variables. Also,
mental ray makes sure that an <a href="node159.html#INDEX835">init
shader</a> runs once, in a single thread, before the actual shader
runs in one or more threads. This makes init shaders the natural
place to set up the shader user pointer, perhaps to store
preprocessed shader parameters. See section
<a href="node156.html#multithreading">multithreading</a> for more
information on multithreaded shader design.</p>
<p>Shaders should never write to shader parameters because they
might be accessed by other threads or hosts or by future frames,
and because shader and interface assignments might exist that would
be destroyed. (In general, no shader should ever modify the
scene.)</p>
