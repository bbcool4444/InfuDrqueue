<h2 id="fo:importons">Importons
</h2>

<p>Importons are "virtual particles". In some aspects they are
similar to photons: they bounce in the scene. There are significant
differences though: unlike photons, importons do not distribute
energy. Instead, they contain a color describing with which factor
an illumination at a certain location would contribute to the final
image. That way, they provide an information for the rendering core
on how the computational efforts should be distributed in order to
get an image of best quality with limited computational resources.</p>
<p>
Unlike photons, importons are emitted from the camera and bounce
towards lights, i.e. in the direction opposite to the photons.
However, the duality of lights makes it possible to apply photon
shaders to importons. For simplicity reason, mental ray does not
introduce a new type of shaders but uses photon shaders for
importons as well.</p>
<p>
Importons are used as a supplementary mechanism which improves the
rendering quality and performance. It is used as the primary mechanism
to drive the quality of <a href="irradparticles.html">irradiance particles</a>.
Another usage in current mental ray is to improve the quality of the
globillum photon map. It allows to
dramatically reduce the size (and thus speed up lookup) of photon maps
with a help of the merging within a variable merging distance which is
determined with the help of importons. Such variable merging distance
is superior to the existing constant merging distance.</p>
<p>If enabled, importons are shot before photon maps are created.
They are used to during the globillum photon map creation. As the
are not relevant for globillum photon map nearest neighbor lookups,
importons are discarded once the photon map is created.</p>
<p>
The importons map is controlled by scene
