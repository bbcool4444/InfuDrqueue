</pre>
<p><a id="INDEX339"></a>Instances place cameras,
lights, objects, and instance groups into the scene. Without
instances, these entities have no effect; they are not tessellated
and are not scheduled for processing. An instance has a <i>name</i>
that identifies the instance when it is placed into an instance
group (see below). Every instance references exactly one element
<i>element</i>, which must be the name of a camera, a light, an
object, or an instance group. If the instanced item is a geometry
shader <i>function</i>, the scene element created by this special
shader is actually used as the instanced item.</p>
<p><a id="INDEX340"></a>The <tt>hide</tt> flag can
be set to <tt>on</tt> to disable the instance and the element it
references. This is useful to temporarily suspend an instance to
evaluate a subset of the scene, without deleting and later
recreating suspended parts. <tt>hide</tt> is <tt>off</tt> by
default.</p>

<p>The
<tt id="mi:visisible">visible</tt>, <tt id="mi:shadow">shadow</tt>,
<tt id="mi:shadowmap">shadowmap</tt>, <tt id="mi:trace">trace</tt>,
<tt id="mi:face">face</tt> flags, and <tt id="mi:reflection">reflection</tt>,
<tt id="mi:refraction">refraction</tt>, <tt id="mi:transparency">transparency</tt>,
<tt id="mi:caustic">caustic</tt>, <tt id="mi:globillum">globillum</tt>,
<tt id="mi:finalgather">finalgather</tt> modes (further referred
to as flags) are used to control the rendering properties of the
final object instance. They are inherited down the
<a href="node83.html#INDEX286">scene DAG</a>, so that flags in instances
lower (or closer) to the objects override those in instances higher up.
The ones from the instance closest to the object are merged with the
corresponding object flags. The resulting values become the effective
flags for rendering. If no flags are specified in the relevant instances,
only the object flags are used. For the exact definition of these flags
refer to the <a href="node83.html#SECTION81">object</a> description.</p>

<p>The <tt>shadow</tt>, <tt>reflection</tt>, <tt>refraction</tt>,
and <tt>transparency</tt> mode bitmaps contain four relevant bits, which
are represented by the following <dfn>mode</dfn> values:
<ul>
<li>[<code>1</code>] to enable casting the effect,</li>
<li>[<code>2</code>] to enable receiving the effect,</li>
<li>[<code>4</code>] to disable casting the effect,</li>
<li>[<code>8</code>] to disable receiving the effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>If no bit is set then this instance does not enforce any changes of flags
on the object, potential flags from instances higher up in the DAG hierarchy
will be taken. Multiple bits in the bitmap may be set; the final <dfn>mode</dfn>
value of this bitmap is the sum of the individual values listed above.
Obviously, some combinations don't make sense, like both enable+disable either
cast [<code>5</code>] or receive [<code>10</code>]. Typical values are:
<ul>
<li>[<code>1</code>] force cast,
<li>[<code>2</code>] force receive,
<li>[<code>3</code>] force all (cast and receive),
<li>[<code>4</code>] force no cast,
<li>[<code>6</code>] force receive-only (no cast but receive),
<li>[<code>8</code>] force no receive,
<li>[<code>9</code>] force cast-only (no receive but cast),
<li>[<code>12</code>] force no effect (no cast nor receive).
</ul>
<p>Note, that <em>"cast the effect"</em> here means <em>"cast shadows"</em>
or <em>"cast reflections"</em> onto other objects (or, become visible in
reflections on other objects). This is the opposite sense of
<em>"cast a ray"</em>. For example, a material shader attached to an object
will <em>"cast reflection rays"</em> only if the object has the <i>receive</i>
reflection flag enabled.
<p>For backwards compatibility, the reflection and refraction casting
and receiving bits can be overwritten simultaneously with the
<b>trace on|off</b> flag.

<p>The <code>caustic</code> and <code>globillum</code> <i>mode</i>
bitmaps contains four bits in the mode mask, as well as 2 more bits
to store <tt>on</tt> and <tt>off</tt> switches, which can be used to hide
the object completely from the photon tracing effects. The switch bits can
only be controlled using the <tt>on</tt> and <tt>off</tt> syntax in .mi scene
files. However, shaders can access these bits in a single bit field.
The desired behavior is a combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>[<code>1</code>] to enable caustic casting,</li>
<li>[<code>2</code>] to enable caustic receiving,</li>
<li>[<code>4</code>] to disable caustic casting,</li>
<li>[<code>8</code>] to disable caustic receiving,</li>
<li>[<code>off</code>(16)] to hide from caustic photons, and
<li>[<code>on</code>(32)]  to enable interaction with caustic photons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, that the enable bits are contained in the two lowest and the highest
bits. Obviously, the values <code>1</code> and <code>4</code>, <code>2</code>
and <code>8</code>, and <code>16</code> and <code>32</code> cannot be mixed,
respectively. If the <i>mode</i> value is omitted, the default is <code>3</code>
(enable casting and receiving). The fifth and sixth bits control "visibility to
photons"; if disabled then photons do not intersect this object and fly right
through. This also affects the portion of the scene where photons have an
effect and will be traced by mental ray. For example, if caustics occur only
in a small part of the scene then objects outside that area should be marked
as invisible to caustic photons to tell mental ray it should not waste time
tracing photons there.
<p>The <code>finalgather</code> bitmap and switches work in the same way as
<code>caustic</code> and <code>globillum</code> ones, they just control the
behavior for final gathering rays. Note that the deprecated <b>trace</b> flag,
which is supported for backwards compatibility reasons, will also control
some of the final gathering properties.</p>

<p><a id="INDEX342"></a>The <tt>transform</tt>
statement is followed by 16 numbers that define a 4&times;4 matrix
in row-major order. The matrix establishes the transformation from
the parent coordinate space to the <a href="node101.html#INDEX369">object
space</a> of the instanced
<i>element</i> (<b>not</b> from object to parent space, which is more
common). If the instance is directly attached to the
<a href="node91.html#INDEX351">root instance group</a> the parent
coordinate space is <a href="node101.html#INDEX368">world space</a>.
For example, the following matrix translates the instanced element to
the coordinate <i>(x, y, z)</i>:</p>
<pre>
    transform
        1 0 0 0
        0 1 0 0
        0 0 1 0
        <i>x</i>&thinsp;<i>y</i>&thinsp;<i>z</i> 1
</pre>
<p>The parent-to-local space transformation direction has the effect that
in order to move an instanced object one (local) unit in the (local) +X
direction, <i>x</i> must be decremented by 1.
<p>Instance transformations are ignored if
<a href="node101.html#INDEX370">camera space</a> is in effect in a scene.
This is deprecated and not recommended.

<p><a id="INDEX343"></a>The <tt>motion
transform</tt> matrix specifies a transformation from parent space
to local space for motion blurred geometry. If not specified, the
instance transformation is used for the motion blur transformation.
In this case the parent instance determines whether motion blur is
active or not. Motion blur is activated by specifying a motion
transformation in the <a href="node83.html#INDEX286">scene DAG</a>.
This transformation is propagated through the
<a href="node83.html#INDEX286">scene DAG</a> in the same way as the
instance transformations. The <tt>motion off</tt> statement turns
off all motion information inherited up to this point, as if the
camera and all instances above did not have motion transforms. This
can be used to disable motion transformations for a scene subtree.
The <tt>motion steps</tt> option in the options block
controls the number of segments of the curved
<a href="node83.html#INDEX290">motion path</a> resulting from evaluating
the transformation at different times in the interval 0..1.</p>
<p>If a motion transformation is specified in an object instance,
the triangle vertex points of the tessellated geometry are
transformed by the matrix product of the accumulated instance
matrix and the inverse accumulated motion transformation matrix.
The difference vector between the transformed and the untransformed
triangle vertex point is used as a motion vector in local
<a href="node101.html#INDEX369">object space</a>. If an object has motion
vectors attached to the vertices, the motion vector calculated as
described above is combined with the object motion vector. A motion
transformation can be given for both object and camera instances.
If a motion transformation is specified in a camera instance, the
effective motion transformation for the triangle vertices is the
matrix product of the relative instance and relative camera motion
transformation.</p>
<p>The <tt>override</tt> keyword is a prefix for <tt>material</tt>
and <tt>approximate</tt> statements. It causes the material,
material list, or approximation list to override the materials and
approximations in instances and objects lower in the tree. Without
overriding, lower instances and objects take precedence.</p>
<p><a id="INDEX344"></a> The <i>material_name</i>
is the name of a previously defined material. It is stored along
with the instance. Instance materials are inherited down the
<a href="node83.html#INDEX286">scene DAG</a>. Materials in
instances lower in the <a href="node83.html#INDEX286">scene DAG</a>
(closer to the leaves) override materials in instances higher up.
The material defined lowest becomes the default material for any
polygon or surface in a geometrical object that has no material of
its own.</p>
<p><a id="INDEX345"></a> If a bracketed,
comma-separated list of <i>material_name</i>s is given, mental ray
will use the <i>n</i>-th material in the list if the polygon or
surface label is <i>n</i>. If the label exceeds the length of the
list, the first material in the list is used. Polygon and surface
labels can be specified in the object definition that have the
<tt>tagged</tt> flag set. If this flag is not set, the first
material in the list is used. The list may not be empty.</p>
<p>The <tt>light</tt> and <tt>light shadow</tt> constructs can be
used to specify light lists for illumination and shadow casting,
see <a href="#light_lists">below</a>.</p>
<p><a id="INDEX346"></a> The approximation list
provides default approximations for objects. It is a
comma-separated list of approximation statements, including
displacement approximations, and all flags if applicable (visible,
trace, shadow, caustic, globillum). See page
<a href="node89.html#approx">approx</a> for syntax details. Like
approximations in <a href="node76.html#INDEX180">options
block</a>s, the surface name must be <tt>all</tt>. For example,
this approximation list overrides all approximations in the subtree
below the instance, such that visible objects are tessellated
moderately fine, traced and shadow objects are very coarse, and
visible displacements are very detailed:</p>
<p><a id="INDEX347"></a></p>
<pre>
    override approximate [
        visible approximate fine view length 0.5 all,
        trace shadow approximate regular parametric 3 3 all,
        visible approximate displace fine view length 0.25 all
    ]
</pre>
<p>When rendering with the <i><a href="node34.html">rasterizer</a></i> mode, it is possible to specify
the number of shading samples to be used on a per-instance basis.
This will locally override the setting in the render options. It is
also possible to specify this setting per-object if needed, but the
instance setting will override the object setting when both are
present. Overriding the option setting would normally be done to
keep the scene settings low, to keep rendering times down, but
boost the quality of the rendering of one or more objects or
instances, to achieve the required quality in the final image.</p>
<p>A label integer can be attached to an instance using the
<tt>tag</tt> statement. Labels are not used by mental ray in any
way, but a shader can use the
<i><a href="miquery.html#api:mi_query">mi_query</a></i> function to obtain the
label and perform instance-specific operations.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="node83.html#INDEX285">user data</a> can be
attached with a <tt>data</tt> statement. The argument must be the
name of a previously defined data element in the scene file. If the
argument is missing, a previously existing data reference is
removed.</p>
<p><a id="INDEX348"></a>An instance may define
parameters. Instance parameters are evaluated during scene
preprocessing during preprocessing. Whenever the initial scene
traversal finds an instance, it calls the
<a href="node76.html#INDEX224">inheritance function</a> defined in the
options element with the parent instance parameters and the
parameters of the new instance. The inheritance function must then
compute a new parameter set, which becomes the parent parameters
for any future instances found in the <i>element</i> subtree below
the new instance, if <i>element</i> is an instance group (if not,
no sub-instances can exist and recursion ends). The inheritance
function is also called if there is no parent instance yet or if
the new instance contains no parameters. The final parameter set
created by the inheritance function called for the bottom-level
instance (which instances a camera, light, or object) is made
available to shaders, in addition to the regular shader
parameters.</p>
<p>mental ray supprts <a href="node76.html#INDEX225">traversal function</a>s
in the options block, which are called like
<a href="node76.html#INDEX224">inheritance function</a>s but have more
control over the inheritance process. For example, they can control
not only instance parameters but also flags, materials, and
transformation matrices.</p>
<p>The instance parameters must be declared just like shader
parameters. The <tt>declare</tt> command must name the inheritance
function, as specified in the <tt>options</tt> element. All
instances share the same declaration. Note that this limits the
portability of the scene - it is difficult to merge it with another
scene that uses a different parameter inheritance function.</p>
<p>If <tt>transform</tt>, <tt>motion transform</tt>, and
<tt>material</tt> are given without arguments, the respective
feature is turned off. This is useful for incremental changes. It
is not relevant for the initial definition because these features
are off by default when an instance is created.</p>
<p>The <i>element</i> may be named in more than one instance. This
is called "<a href="node75.html#INDEX174">multiple instancing</a>."
If two instances name the same object, the object appears twice in
the scene, even though it is stored only once in the scene
database. This greatly reduces memory consumption. For example, it
is sufficient to create one wheel object for a car, and then
instance it four times. Each of the four instances will contain a
different transformation matrix to place the wheels in four
different locations. (This implies that multiple instancing is not
useful in camera space mode because in this mode the
transformations are ignored.) It is also possible to apply multiple
instancing to <b><a id="INDEX349"></a>object
group</b>s to replicate entire sub-scenes.</p>
<p>If the instanced item is a "<a href="node179.html#INDEX857">geometry
shader</a>", the <i>function</i>
is called with shader parameters and the scene element created by
the shader is defined in the local coordinate space of the
instance. The geometry shader is called just before tessellation
takes place. The following example uses a geometry shader
<i>mib_geo_sphere</i>:</p>
<pre>
    instance "sphere"
        geometry "mib_geo_sphere" ()
    end instance
</pre>
<p>This example creates a spherical object procedurally. It uses
the syntax for <a href="node65.html#INDEX144">anonymous shader</a>;
as usual the named shader syntax using the <tt>shader</tt> keyword
and named shader assignments using the " <tt>=</tt>" sign can also
be used. As usual, shader lists may be used; if the shader is
correctly written all created objects are put in a group and
instanced together. Named shaders created inside or outside
procedural object definitions are in global scope and can be shared
with other objects.</p>
<p>For a complete example for building scene graphs with instances
and instance groups, see below.</p>

<h4>Light Lists <sup>3.5</sup></h4>
<p><a id="light_lists"></a>
<b>Light lists</b> allow to store relations between instances of lights
and objects in the mental ray scene database, instead of passing this
information through shaders. Separate light lists for shadow casting
are supported. This offers the flexibility to share a single material on
multiple objects with different lights. However, cooperation by shaders
is required to utilize these light lists.</p>
<p>Light lists are bracketed, comma separateds list of light instances.
The lists may optionally be flagged as <tt>"exclusive"</tt>, in which
case all lights except the named ones are used. An empty exclusive list
results in all lights being used; if no light list is specified then all
lights are usually used as well. The lists may also contain the names of
instance groups besides the names of light instances. In this case, all
lights in the instance groups are used. This offers a convenient way to
attach sets of lights to instances.</p>
<p>The regular <code>light</code> list (without <code>shadow</code> keyword)
is intended to specify the lights to be used for illumination in shaders.
Shaders access the instance light lists with the
<a href="classmi_1_1shader_1_1LightIterator.html">light iterators</a> which
have been added to the shader API. The light iterators may also be used to
read the light lists in the shader for other purposes.</p>
<p>The standard mental ray shader packages make use of light lists: if lights
are specified as parameters to the shaders directly then these lights are used;
otherwise, if a light list is present in the geometry instance, the light list
will be used; otherwise, all lights in the scene are used.</p>
<p>The <code>light shadow</code> list specifies the lights for which the
geometry instance casts shadows, which is independent of the regular light
list. This affects both ray traced shadows as well as shadow maps. If no shadow
light list is specified then the regular light relations will control shadow
relations as well. Note, that a slight performance impact is expected when
shadow light lists are used together with ray traced shadows.</p>
