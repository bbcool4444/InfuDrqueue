<h1 id="sh:shaders">Using and Writing Shaders</h1>

<p id="shaders"><a id="INDEX356"></a>
All color, displacement, contour, and other computation in mental ray
is based on shaders. There are various types of shaders for different
situations, such as material shaders to evaluate the material properties
of a surface, light shaders to control the light-emitting properties
of a light source, lens shaders to specify camera properties other than
the default <a href="node124.html#INDEX488">pinhole camera</a>, and so
on. Much of the power of mental ray relies on the possibility to write
custom shaders and call them during rendering in mental ray. Traditional
custom shaders are written in C/C++, using all language features and the
complete shader interface in mental ray for advanced effects. On the
other hand, <a href="#sh:metasl">MetaSL</a> shaders may be used to write
functions for common shading tasks like defining material behavior in a
standardized form independent of the computing platform or the final
renderer.

<p>Vendors and integrators of mental ray typically provide custom shader
libraries which implement compatibility with their products, like Autodesk
3ds Max, Maya, and Softimage, Dassault Syst&egrave;mes CATIA and SolidWorks,
and others.

<h2 id="sh:metasl">MetaSL Shaders <span class="new">3.8</span></h2>
<p>
MetaSL shaders are provided in files with <code>.msl</code> or <code>.xmsl</code>
file extension. If such a file name is announced to mental ray, for example
with the <code>$include</code> statement in a <code>.mi</code> file), it is
treated as MetaSL shader source code. mental ray will read, parse, and convert
it to an internal representation. This internal representation is then used to
create a shader declaration, as well as intermediate shader code in a native
language of the current platform for final compilation/linking and execution
in mental ray.  The shader code generation is performed by so-called MetaSL
back-ends. mental ray currently provides two back-end alternatives :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#sh:metaslc++">C++ back-end</a> using an external compiler installed
in the target machine,</li>
<li>
<a href="#sh:metaslllvm">LLVM back-end</a> using built-in just-in-time compilation.
<span class="new">3.8</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <dfn id="sh:metaslc++">C++ back-end</dfn> is using an external C++
compiler and linker that is automatically invoked on intermediate source files
to create a dynamically linked shared library in the directory containing
temporary files. That resulting shared object .dll or .so is then loaded into
mental ray. In order for C++ compilation to succeed, the C++ compiler needs
to be pointed to include directories containing mental ray headers files
(like <code>shader.h</code> and others), as well as MetaSL C++ header files
(in the directory rooted at <code>mi/metasl_runtime/*</code>).
For convenience, mental ray now applies the common mental ray include path
also to the compiler invocations automatically. In other words, the include
paths may be specified on the mental ray standalone command line (option
<code>-I</code>) or with a registry variable (<code>{_MI_REG_INCLUDE}</code>).
<p>
On Windows platforms, shaders need to be linked against <code>shader.lib</code>
or <code>ray.lib</code>. If <code>shader.lib</code> is not present in the compiler
library search path, it needs to be specified explicitly (like with command-line
options <code>-ld_libs</code> and/or <code>-ld_path</code>).</p>
<p>
Note, that the C++ compilation and linkage is done on demand. For shader
declaration, parsing and analysis of the MetaSL source code is done when the
MetaSL file is loaded.<p>
<p>
The <dfn id="sh:metaslllvm">LLVM back-end</dfn> is using internal compilation
technology, and is executing the generated code using a built-in <em>low-level
virtual machine</em>. No intermediate files are created and no external tools
are required to use this back-end. To enable it the <code>{_MI_REG_METASL_BACKEND}</code>
mental ray registry variable need to be set to the value <code>"llvm"</code>.
This will automatically disable the C++ MetaSL back-end.</p>

<h2 id="sh:native">Native Shaders</h2>

<p>Here are the steps necessary to create a native shader:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a .mi declaration for the shader, providing the shader
name, return type, shader parameter names and types, and the
version to mental ray.</li>
<li>Write a C shader parameter data structure that agrees exactly
with the .mi parameter declaration. (The
<b><a id="INDEX357"></a>mkmishader</b> utility can do this
translation.)</li>
<li>Write the shader function in C or C++, using the correct
signature. The shader computes a result from its shader parameters
and the state, and by calling shader interface functions provided
by mental ray.</li>
<li>Write a version shader (same name with <tt>_version</tt>
appended to the name) that returns a version number that matches
the version number in the .mi declaration.</li>
<li>If required, write initialization and exit shaders (same name
as the shader with <tt>_init</tt> and <tt>_exit</tt> appended,
respectively).</li>
<li>Compile and link the shader, and create a shared
<b><a id="INDEX358"></a>shader library</b>
(<a href="node166.html#INDEX844">DSO</a> or
<a href="node166.html#INDEX845">DLL</a>). This step can be omitted but
DSO/DLLs are easiest to use and much faster to link than objects or
sources. Libraries must be installed on all machines on the net
that are used as masters or network rendering slaves.</li>
<li>Use a <tt>$include</tt> statement in the scene .mi file to load
the .mi declaration and a <tt>link</tt> (or <tt>code</tt> or
<tt>$code</tt>) statement to load the shader DSO/DLL (or
<a href="node178.html#INDEX856">source code</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if the shader is expected to work on Windows NT, all
four function definitions (the shader, the version function, and
the init and exit shaders) must be preceded with
<tt>DLLEXPORT</tt>. This is a pseudo type specifier that makes the
functions visible to users of the generated shader library. On Unix
systems <tt>DLLEXPORT</tt> evaluates to an empty word.</p>
<p>The shader is then ready to be used in the scene. These steps
are described in detail below.</p>
