<h2>Geometry Shader API</h2>
<p><a id="geoshaderapi"></a> This section
describes the high-level API which provides an easy-to-use scene
definition layer for geometry shaders. The high-level API functions
are mainly concerned with atomic creation of high-level elements
like those found in the .mi language. Many such elements,
especially geometric objects, are built from multiple scene
database entries with numerous internal references. This internal
complexity is hidden by the API module and expanded automatically.
However, simple elements such as cameras are created by API calls
but filling in certain parameters requires struct member
assignment. To simplify the API call interface, API calls that
would do nothing but assign a variable to another have been
omitted.</p>
<p>Conceptually, database storage is performed on four layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>At the lowest level, MEM is handling plain unstructured memory
allocation on a single host, identified by pointers.</li>
<li>The DB layer on top of MEM provides network-wide global shared
memory identified by tags, and maintains type information.</li>
<li>The SCENE layer adds structure to DB memory blocks, and
provides operations on typed data including default values and
graph structuring operations.</li>
<li>At the top level, the API module provides a high-level
object-based scene creation and rendering service based on symbolic
names.</li>
</ol>
<p>This section should be read in conjunction with the section
<a href="node196.html#scenedatastruct">scenedatastruct</a>, which
describes simple data structures that the API module requires
assignments to. For example, API contains functions to begin and
finish the creation of a camera, but provides no functions for
setting each of the many fields of these structures. Instead, they
are simply written to the fields directly.</p>
<p>The API module has been patterned after the .mi language, to
the point where the .mi <i>yacc</i> grammar consists almost
entirely of one or very few API calls or variable assignments for
every statement and clause. To understand the correct order of API
calls, refer to the .mi language description (page
<a href="node60.html#scenechapter">scenechapter</a>). The complete
<i>yacc</i> grammar that parses the .mi language, including C
code, is reprinted in appendix B. For information on the syntax of
a <i>yacc</i> grammar description, refer to the Unix manual page
for <i>yacc</i>.</p>
<p>Note that all character string arguments passed to any of the
API functions below are expected to have been allocated with
<i><a href="node155.html#INDEX794">mi_mem_allocate</a></i> or, more
commonly, <i><a href="node155.html#INDEX797">mi_mem_strdup</a></i>.
All API functions release such strings using <i>mi_mem_release</i>,
so the same allocated string may not be passed to API twice.
Similarly, <tt>miDlist</tt>s created with
<i>mi_api_dlist_create</i> and passed as an argument to an API call
are freed by API, and should not be passed to API twice. The reason
for this is that API keeps most strings for extended periods of
time, so allocation is almost always necessary <i>somewhere</i>,
and putting the burden on the API caller avoids double allocations
in cases where the caller works with allocated strings anyway (for
example in <i>yacc</i> parsers). In the few cases where API could
work with non-allocated strings (
<i><a href="node195.html#INDEX1059">mi_api_debug</a></i>, for example)
allocation is required anyway to avoid requiring allocation for
some strings but not others, which would invite hard-to-find bugs.
Functions whose name does not begin with <i>mi_api_</i> generally
do not require string allocation.</p>
<p>Most API functions return a boolean, a pointer, or a tag. If the
function succeeds, <tt>miTRUE</tt>, a non-null pointer, or a
non-null tag is returned, respectively. If an error occurs,
<tt>miFALSE</tt> or a null pointer or tag is returned; this means
that errors can be caught with C's "<tt>!</tt>" operator. The tags
returned by the calls whose names end in <tt>_end</tt> are merely a
convenience; they are not generally useful to standard name-based
translators.</p>
<p>Note that many of these functions come in <i>begin</i> and
<i>end</i> pairs, such as
<i><a href="node189.html#INDEX942">mi_api_object_begin</a></i> and
<i><a href="node189.html#INDEX949">mi_api_object_end</a></i>. These calls may
not be interleaved in any way; there may only be one open
unfinished <i>begin</i> ... <i>end</i> bracket at any time in a
single thread. (Multiple threads can have such an open bracket
each.)</p>
