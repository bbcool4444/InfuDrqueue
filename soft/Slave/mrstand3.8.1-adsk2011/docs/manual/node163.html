<h3>Thread-Local Storage</h3>
<p><a id="shadertls"></a><a id="INDEX838"></a><a id="INDEX839"></a>
Sometimes shaders need to share data, but need to
modify it. Sharing would allow using the first method for constant
data, but that does not permit changing the data during rendering
because no consistent writes are possible - multiple instances of
the shaders in different threads may write to the same data
simultaneously. This can corrupt even simple operations such as
incrementing a variable, because the execution order is
unpredictable. The sequence <i>read_A</i> <i>write_A</i>
<i>read_B</i> <i>write_B</i> in threads A and B works, but there is
no way to avoid the sequence <i>read_A</i> <i>read_B</i>
<i>write_A</i> <i>write_B</i>. This problem is called a
<b><a id="INDEX840"></a>race condition</b>, and it can cause
one increment to be lost, in rare and hard-to-debug cases. Locking
would prevent that but may cause an unacceptable performance
loss.</p>
<p>Thread-local storage avoids the race condition by providing one
copy of the data to each thread. Multiple threads can execute
simultaneously but with any single thread the execution is strictly
sequential, so that the read/write
<a href="node163.html#INDEX840">race condition</a> cannot happen. Here is
an example that counts shader calls:</p>
<pre>
     DLLEXPORT void myshader(           /* main shader */
         miState         *state,
         struct myshader *paras,
         miBoolean       *inst_req)
     {
         int             *counter;

         mi_query(miQ_FUNC_TLS_GET, state, miNULLTAG, &amp;counter);
         if (!counter) {
             counter = mi_mem_allocate(sizeof(int));
             mi_query(miQ_FUNC_TLS_SET, state, miNULLTAG, &amp;counter);
             *counter = 0;
         }
         (*counter)++;
         ...
         return(miTRUE);
     }

     DLLEXPORT miBoolean myshader_init(
        miState          *state,
        struct myshader  *paras,
        miBoolean        *init_req)
     {
        *init_req = miTRUE;
        return(miTRUE);
     }

     DLLEXPORT void myshader_exit(      /* exit shader */
         miState         *state,
         struct myshader *paras)
     {
         int             **ptrs;
         int             num, i, total = 0;

         if (!paras)
             return(miTRUE);
         mi_query(miQ_FUNC_TLS_GETALL, state, miNULLTAG, &amp;counters, &amp;num);
         for (i=0; i &lt; num; i++) {
             total += *counters[i];
             mi_mem_release(counters[i]);
         }
         mi_info("myshader was called %d times", total);
         return(miTRUE);
     }
</pre>
<p>The thread-local data is a single integer that counts shader
calls in this thread. Since init shaders are called once per shader
or once per shader instance, but not once every time the shader is
called in a new thread, the data cannot be installed and
initialized in the init shader. Instead, it is created in the main
body if it did not already exist. This is safe because no two
threads will get the same pointer returned by
<tt>miQ_FUNC_TLS_GET</tt>. (Note that setting * <i>counter</i> to
zero is actually redundant because
<i><a href="node155.html#INDEX794">mi_mem_allocate</a></i> always returns
zeroed memory.)</p>
<p>The example exit shader collects all the thread-local counters
of all threads that installed a counter, and computes and prints
the total. It is done during shader instance exit, not the shader
exit, by checking that <i>paras</i> is nonzero. This requires
shader instance init/exit to be enabled in the init function by
setting <i>init_req</i> to <tt>miTRUE</tt>.</p>
<p>This will only work on a single host because each host exits its
own shaders, and there is no way to communicate the counters
between hosts. Moreover, slave hosts may come and go, and may call
their exit shaders multiple times for a single frame.</p>
<p><a id="querytls"></a> Thread-local shader
storage relies on three new
<i><a href="miquery.html#api:mi_query">mi_query</a></i> modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>miQ_FUNC_TLS_SET</tt> saves a user pointer passed as fourth
argument. Different threads will store the pointers separately and
will not interfere with each other. Note that this mode differs
from all other <i><a href="miquery.html#api:mi_query">mi_query</a></i>
modes in that it stores data instead of retrieving data.</li>
<li><tt>miQ_FUNC_TLS_GET</tt> retrieves the previously set pointer
into the address given by the fourth argument, or a null pointer if
no pointer has been set (which normally prompts the caller to set
the pointer now).</li>
<li><tt>miQ_FUNC_TLS_GETALL</tt> retrieves the address of an array
of all the pointers stored using <tt>miQ_FUNC_TLS_SET</tt>, one per
thread that did so. The size of the table is stored in the address
provided as the fifth argument and should point to an integer
variable. Threads that did not set a pointer are not represented in
the array. This mode should be used in the exit shader to release
all allocated thread-local data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second argument to <i><a href="miquery.html#api:mi_query">mi_query</a></i>
must be the shader state,
and the third must be a null tag.</p>
