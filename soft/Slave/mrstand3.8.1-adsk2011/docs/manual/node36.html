<h2 id="fo:color">Color Calculations</h2>
<p>
By default all <b><a id="INDEX69"></a>color</b>s
in mental ray are given in the <b><a id="INDEX70"></a> RGBA
color space</b> and all internal calculations
are performed in RGBA. The <b><a id="INDEX71"></a>alpha channel</b>
is used to determine transparency;
0 means fully transparent and 1 means fully opaque. mental ray uses
premultiplied colors, which means that the R, G, and B components
are scaled by A and may not exceed A if A is less than 1.0. This
becomes significant only when colors are stored in 8-bit or 16-bit
frame buffers because the store operation requires quantization and
clipping of arbitrary floating-point values to the fixed integer
ranges of the frame buffer formats. Optionally, RGBA colors may be
stored in the output image in non-premultiplied form to increase
the precision of highly transparent pixels, but by convention,
mental ray and all shaders work with premultiplied colors (there is
no precision loss here because mental ray works with floating-point
values). Premultiplication is used to simplify compositing
operations.</p>
<p>Internally, <a href="node36.html#INDEX69">color</a>s are not
restricted to the unit cube in RGB space. As a final step before
output, colors are clipped using one of two methods. By default,
the red, green and blue values are simply truncated. Optionally,
colors may be clipped using a <b><a id="INDEX72"></a>desaturation</b>
method which maintains intensity (if
possible), but shifts the hue towards the white axis of the cube.
Desaturation color clipping may be selected with either the
<tt>-desaturate on</tt> option on the command line or
<tt>desaturate on</tt> in the <a href="node76.html#INDEX0">options</a>
block in the scene. The alpha
channel is always truncated.</p>
<p>mental ray also supports three different color clipping modes
that control how premultiplied colors are clipped before storing in
the frame buffer:</p>
<dl style="margin-left: 2em">
<dt>rgb</dt>
<dd>ensures that R, G, and B never exceed alpha by increasing alpha
if necessary, and preserving R, G, and B.</dd>
<dt>alpha</dt>
<dd>makes the same guarantee, but reduces R, G, and/or B to
preserve the alpha channel.</dd>
<dt>raw</dt>
<dd>applies no color clipping whatever.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In any of these case, the result is clipped into the 0...1
range.</p>
<p>As a special case, mental ray supports the floating-point TIFF
image file format, and a proprietary floating-point format (ctfp),
that do not require any quantization, clipping, or loss of
precision. Therefore, desaturation and color clipping are never
applied.</p>
<p>mental ray also supports the <b><a id="INDEX73"></a>RGBE</b>
<b><a id="INDEX74"></a>high
dynamic range</b> color data format. Its stores RGB colors (no
alpha) as floating-point values with an 8-bit mantissa and an 8-bit
shared exponent. The shared exponent allows a large value range
from 0 to 10<sup>38</sup> (actually more, but the internal
calculations use floats), and has the effect that the ratio between
the largest and the smallest component cannot exceed 255. It
combines the storage efficiency of 8-bit RGB with the ability to
store values greater than 1.0.</p>

<h3 id="fo:colorprofile">Color Profiles</h3>
<p>
mental ray supports color profiles. The following color profiles
are predefined:</p>

</table>
<p>Color profiles are enabled by giving a profile in the options
block</p>
<pre>
      options "<var>opt</var>"
           colorprofile "<var>profile_name</var>"
      end options
</pre>
<p>The above color profile determines the rendering color space.
The use of color profiles implies a floating point color frame
buffer. Colors in the frame buffer are stored in an internal color
space, that is, the colors of the rendering color space are
transformed to internal color space before they are written to the
color frame buffer. The CIE color profiles are in general
unsuitable for rendering purposes, but they may be used for output
purposes. The sRGB and HDTV color spaces differ only in their gamma
values. Ideally gamma correction is performed by the viewing
device. However, if the output image format has a resolution of
less than twelve bits per color channel, then banding artifacts may
result. For this reason it may be desirable to perform the gamma
correction before the image is written out. Therefore mental ray
offers the gamma corrected profiles <tt>"micsSRGBg"</tt> and
<tt>"micsHDTVg"</tt> as well as the not gamma corrected
<tt>"micsSRGB"</tt> with its alias <tt>"micsHDTV"</tt>.</p>
<p>Color parameters of shaders may also be flagged with a color
profile. The application of such a transformation cannot be
automated, since which color arguments of a shader should be
transformed to render color space depends on the inner workings of
the involved shader. As a rule of thumb, color parameters
describing material properties should not be transformed, while
color parameters describing light properties should be transformed.
If a color parameter is not flagged with a color profile, then it
is assumed to be given in render color space.</p>
