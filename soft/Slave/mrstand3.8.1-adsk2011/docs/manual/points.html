<h2>Point Data</h2>
<p>
mental ray supports to store positional data with custom properties in the
scene database for various purposes. This allows to implement rendering
effects which are not attached to a surface but to a point in space (or
time), like global illumination data. Custom applications and shaders may
use it to compute and render particle systems or fluid density grids with
mental ray. Most of the internal point data structures in mental ray which
are used for caching purposes like the <a href="node48.html#INDEX96">photon
map</a> are stored in proprietary formats, giving the freedom to adjust their
behavior at any time in order to add new features or improve performance.
The <a href="#fo:map">map data</a> container, on the other hand, is a general
data storage for point-based data, and designed to be suited for exchange of
public information within the same or with other similar applications.

<h3 id="fo:map">Map Data <span class="recent">3.7</span></h3>
<p>
The <dfn><a href="map_mi.html#mi:map">map data</a></dfn> container allows to
store point-like information in mental ray. It provides support for automatic
caching of data and swapping to disk files, to be able to manage arbitrarily
large amounts of data.
<p>
The position of a point, the primary and mandatory property, can be specified
in 1-dimensional up to 6-dimensional space, typical applications may use the
2D or 3D space. Any number of additional data item can be attached to a point
or particle, each identified by type and name. This makes the map data
container a perfect candidate for passing information between renderings,
like between frames of an animation, or even from and to other rendering
solutions. In addition, mental ray is optimizing common access and lookup
methods with the help of acceleration techniques that are optimized for sparse
and non-uniform distributions of the data, like arbitrary clouds of points.
