<h2>Multipass Rendering</h2>
<p><a id="INDEX51"></a><a id="INDEX52"></a>
Sometimes, very large scenes are not rendered in one
pass but in multiple passes, because they are too large for the
machine, or because different passes are rendered on different
machines to increase parallelism, or because some passes are
expected to change while others stay the same, so only the modified
passes need to be rerendered (which is very common in entertainment
content production).</p>
<p>mental ray supports two types of pass renderings: the standard
pixel-based passes using <a href="node37.html#fo:framebuffers">frame
buffers</a> and regular image
<a href="node38.html#fo:outfiles">output files</a>, and advanced
<a href="#fo:samplepass">samples passes</a> using multiple values
per pixel which are stored in special sample files.</p>
<p>It is generally not sufficient to render multiple images and
then composite them into one. Pass compositing is not simple alpha
blending but a complex user-defined process that involves at least
the Z depth. Although mental ray supports saving the Z buffer to
files, there is only one Z value per pixel.

<h3>Sample Passes</h3>
<p>mental ray supports advanced <a href="node97.html#INDEX354">pass
rendering</a> by saving rendering results not as image files but as
sample files. Every primary ray
is a sample, and is stored with all available frame buffer values.
If the scene contains motion, an averaged result over all temporal
samples is stored. The file format used for sample files is
unpublished and may change with new versions of mental ray, it is
not useful as a data interchange format for other programs, and is
not intended for long-term storage. Merging is done by a
user-defined function (if absent, a simple Z switcher is used) that
has access to all frame buffer results of all passes, one sample at
a time. Sample pass rendering is controlled with a pass statement
script in the camera definition that is similar to
<a href="node77.html#INDEX227">output statement</a>s.</p>
<p>mental ray uses compression to reduce the size of sample pass
files. Sample pass files are generally backwards-compatible, but
not forward-compatible. Also, passes created with and without the
<a href="node34.html#INDEX67">rasterizer</a> (formerly called
<a href="node34.html#INDEX66">Rapid Motion</a>) should not be
merged because the sampling patterns do not agree: passes rendered
with the rasterizer are based on sampling of (sub)pixels, whenever
passes rendered without it are based on sampling of (sub)pixel
corners. For this reason, in most cases passes rendered without the
rasterizer have 1 sample higher resolution per rendered tile.
mental ray can also merge sample pass files that were created with
dissimilar max sampling rates using appropriate upsampling or
downsampling, although it is recommended to use matching sampling
densities. Sample pass rendering does not work with slave
hosts.</p>
