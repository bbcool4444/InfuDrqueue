<h2>Ambient Occlusion</h2>
<p>Ambient occlusion is a technique which adds visual realism to the image
without being physically correct. The ambient occlusion result can be used
to darken concave areas, which human eye perceives as indirect illumination
shadows, or <dfn>contact shadows</dfn>. The advantage of ambient occlusion
is its computational speed. As it does not require any shading and may be
computed with very short rays, the performance may be significantly higher
than for <a href="node52.html">final gathering</a>.</p>
<p>Ambient occlusion is enabled by default. However, no actual computations
will happen until requested by further settings or by shaders. The ambient
occlusion cache is set <tt>off</tt> by default. In this mode, only shaders
which <a href="node140.html#api:mi_ambient_occlusion">call for ambient
occlusion</a> values will initiate computation on demand.
If no such shaders exist in the scene, there is no overhead compared to the
rendering of scenes with ambient occlusion turned off. In case the ambient
occlusion caching is enabled then mental ray will perform computations before
rendering starts, to fill the cache, and re-generate its content in every
frame of an animation.</p>
<p>The global defaults for ambient occlusion settings can be specified as
<a href="node76.html#ambient_occlusion">scene options</a> or on the
mental ray <a href="node245.html#cli:ao">command line</a>.
Most of these values can be overwritten by a shader.

<p>The <dfn id="fo:ao_cache">ambient occlusion caching</dfn> may be enabled
for the current rendering to gain overall speed. In this case, several passes
will be computed. In the first pass, some ambient occlusion points are created
on a coarse grid. Subsequent passes refine the grid adaptively. The grid layout
is derived from the current view so that grid points projected into screen
space align with the pixels in the final image. The density of the grid is
determined by the <code class="mi">cache density</code> setting, which
specifies the upper bound for the number of ambient occlusion points per pixel.
Increasing the image resolution without adjusting the density will indirectly
increase the size of the cache to retain quality. During tile rendering,
ambient occlusion values are interpolated from several ambient occlusion points
closest to the lookup location. The number of points to be used for
interpolation determines the smoothness of the result, and can be adjusted
with the <code class="mi">cache points</code> setting.</p>
