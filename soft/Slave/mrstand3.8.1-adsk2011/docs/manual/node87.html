<h3 id="mi:hair">Hair Geometry</h3>

<p id="INDEX325">
Rendering hair is a difficult problem for triangle rendering because the
number of hairs is typically very large (hundreds of thousands or millions),
and each hair has a very large bounding box that it fills poorly. For this
reason a special <dfn id="mi:hairprimitive">hair primitive</dfn> was
introduced which is based on a curve description of hairs with a compact
data layout to avoid the storage overhead in comparison to triangle strips.</p>

</pre>
<p>The object header is similar to the headers for all other
geometry types, but the standard <code>group...end group</code>
block is replaced with <code>hair...end hair</code>.
This block begins with a common header, followed by a scalar list,
followed by a hair list. The header has the following optional statements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>material</b> specifies the material to use when shading
a hair. It is shared by all hairs in this object. If missing, the
<a href="node79.html#INDEX242">material</a> is inherited from the
instance.</li>
<li>The <b>radius</b> specified the global radius of all hairs.
This number may be overridden by hair or vertex radii if defined.
It is defined in <a href="node101.html#INDEX369">object space</a>
and typically a very small number. The default is 1.</li>
<li>The <b>approximate</b> specifies the number of segments used to
approximate each B&eacute;zier hair segment, if the degree is 2 or
3. The default is 1.</li>
<li>The <b>degree</b> is the degree of the B&eacute;zier curves
that approximate each hair. Valid values are 1 (linear), 2
(quadric), or 3 (cubic). Each hair must have
<span class="math">(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;degree&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;segments)</span>
vertices, where the number of segments is a positive number.</li>
<li>The <b>max size</b> defines the leaf size of the hair BSP tree
that is created by mental ray to facilitate finding hairs during
rendering. The default is 32. For a discussion of BSP trees, see
the options block, which defines parameters for the BSP tree used
for triangle intersection.</li>
<li>The <b>max depth</b> defines the depth of the hair BSP tree.
The default is 20.</li>
<li>The <b>hair n</b> statement, if present, specifies that each
hair has an associated normal vector consisting of three
scalars.</li>
<li>The <b>hair m</b> statement, if present, specifies that each
hair has <i>hm</i> associated motion vectors consisting of three
scalars each.</li>
<li>The <b>hair t</b> statement, if present, specifies that each
hair has <i>ht</i> associated texture scalars.</li>
<li>The <b>hair u</b> statement, if present, specifies that each
hair has <i>hu</i> associated user scalars.</li>
<li>The <b>hair radius</b> statement, if present, specifies that
each hair has an associated radius. No global radius may be
present.</li>
<li>The <b>vertex n</b> statement, if present, specifies that each
vertex has an associated normal vector consisting of three scalars.
If present, <tt>hair n</tt> is ignored.</li>
<li>The <b>vertex m</b> statement, if present, specifies that each
vertex has <i>vm</i> associated motion vectors consisting of three
scalars each. If present, <tt>hair m</tt> is ignored.</li>
<li>The <b>vertex t</b> statement, if present, specifies that each
vertex has <i>vt</i> associated texture scalars.</li>
<li>The <b>vertex u</b> statement, if present, specifies that each
vertex has <i>vu</i> associated user scalars.</li>
<li>The <b>vertex radius</b> statement, if present, specifies that
each vertex has an associated radius. No global radius may be
present. If present, <b>hair radius</b> is ignored.</li>
<li>The <b>scalar</b> list begins with the number of scalars that
follow in angle brackets, followed by that many scalar values.</li>
<li>The <b>hair</b> list begins with the number of hairs that
follow plus 1 in angle brackets, followed by that many hair
offsets.</li>
</ul>
<p>It does not make sense to specify <tt>hair n</tt> if there is
also a <tt>vertex hair</tt> because all hair normals will be
overridden. Similarly, if vertex radii are used, no hair radii (or
the global radius) should be present. If any normals are specified,
the hairs are not intersected like cylinders but like oriented flat
ribbons.</p>
<p>The scalar list defines a sequence of hairs. Each hair consists
of a certain number of scalars that describe the entire hair,
followed by another number of scalars that describe each vertex of
the hair. The layout of these sequences of scalars is identical for
all hairs, except that each hair may have a different number of
vertices. It is not possible to have one hair with three texture
scalars and another with two, for example. Here is the exact
sequence of scalars for a single hair:</p>
<p>Header:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there was a <tt>hair n</tt> statement, three scalars for the
hair normal (X, Y, Z).</li>
<li><i>hm</i> motion scalars (X, Y, Z, X, Y, Z, ...).</li>
<li><i>ht</i> texture scalars.</li>
<li><i>hu</i> user scalars.</li>
<li>If there was a <tt>hair radius</tt> statement, one radius
scalar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vertices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three mandatory scalars that define the location of the vertex
in <a href="node101.html#INDEX369">object space</a> (X, Y, Z).</li>
<li>If there was a <tt>vertex n</tt> statement, three scalars for
the vertex normal (X, Y, Z).</li>
<li><i>vm</i> motion scalars (X, Y, Z, X, Y, Z, ...).</li>
<li><i>vt</i> texture scalars.</li>
<li><i>vu</i> user scalars.</li>
<li>If there was a <tt>vertex radius</tt> statement, one radius
scalar.</li>
</ul>
<p>All vertices begin with three scalars for the location. The
order of the other vertex scalars, and the order of the header
scalars, is determined by the order of hair and vertex statements.
The lists above correspond to the syntax listing at the beginning
of this section: first n, then m, then t, then u, then radius.</p>
<p>Each hair has only one header but multiple vertices. As
described above, the number of vertices must be
<span class="math">(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;degree&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;segments)</span>,
where <i>segments</i> may be different for each hair. This number
is not encoded in the hair but in the separate hair list. Note that
hairs do not use texture <i>vectors</i> like polygons and free-form
surfaces but texture <i>scalars</i>. It's up to the shader to
interpret <code>state&rarr;tex_list</code> as a list of scalars,
and properly use them in groups of one, two, three, or whatever is
needed. This makes it possible to avoid the third null component if
only two-component UV textures are needed, for example, which can
save a lot of memory because hair objects tend to have a very large
number of vertices, probably millions.</p>
<p>The hair list specifies where in the scalar list each hair
begins, by offset in the scalar list such that 0 is the first
scalar, 1 is the second scalar, and so on. At the end of this
offset list, one extra offset specifies the last scalar plus one,
where the next hair would begin if there were another one. If all
scalars are used (which is normally the case), the first offset is
0 and the extra one at the end equals the number of scalars. Here
is a simple example for a hair object:</p>
<pre>
    object "hair1"
        visible trace shadow
        tag 1
        hair
            material "mtl"
            radius 0.3
            degree 1
            hair t 2
            vertex t 1
            scalar [ 42 ]
                11 22
                0.0     0.0     0.0 1111
                0.0     1.0     0.0 1112
                1.0     1.0     0.0 1113
                33 44
                0.0     0.0     0.0 1114
                0.0     -1.0    0.0 1115
                -1.0    -1.0    0.0 1116
                55 66
                0.0     0.0     0.0 1117
                0.0     -1.0    0.0 1118
                -1.0    -1.0    0.0 1119
            hair [ 4 ]
                0 14 28 42
        end hair
    end object
</pre>
<p>This example consists of three hairs, each with three vertices.
The header of each hair consists of two texture scalars (11 22, 33
44, and 55 66, respectively). Each vertex consists of four scalars,
three for the location in <a href="node101.html#INDEX369">object
space</a> and one more for a vertex texture. The shader will
receive three texture scalars, two from the hair and one more from
the vertices. The former are copied from the hair that was hit, and
the latter is interpolated from the nearest two vertices. They are
stored in <code>state&rarr;tex_list</code> as if it were a scalar
array, header texture scalars first, so the two hair texture
scalars end up in <i>tex_list[0].x</i> and <i>tex_list[0].y</i>,
and the vertex texture scalar ends up in <i>tex_list[0].z</i>. It
is best to re-cast <i>tex_list</i> to a miScalar pointer in the
hair shader.</p>
<p>Hair objects may use the same
<a href="node115.html#INDEX440">material shader</a>s as any other object,
but often special hair material shaders are used because although
hair may be a cylinder, it is too thin for properly resolving the
upper and lower edge and the diffuse terminator and the highlight.
There is a simplified hair illumination shader in the base shader
library, <i>mib_illum_hair</i> that implements a much more
effective hair shading model.</p>
<p>When rendering hair with the raytracer, mental ray uses the ray
origin to generate a temporary, flat surface which is as ray-facing
as possible while lying on the hair axis. A corresponding normal is
generated. When rendering with the rasterizer, the hair geometry is
converted to camera-facing geometry, and intersected in the same
manner as other geometric types. Note that a switch from the latter
to the former is performed if both the rasterizer and the raytracer
are active. Hair intersections cannot happen on the same hair
strand twice in a row, thus avoiding surface acne from this switch.
This does have the consequence that individual hair strands cannot
cast shadows on themselves.</p>
