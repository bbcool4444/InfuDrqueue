<h2 id="fo:architecture">Architecture</h2>

<h3 id="fo:parallelism">Parallelism</h3>

<p>mental ray has been designed to take full advantage of parallel hardware
and achieve maximal performance benefit through concurrent execution of
rendering tasks. On multi-processor and multi-core machines it automatically
exploits thread <dfn id="INDEX6">parallelism</dfn> where multiple
<a href="node156.html#INDEX802">thread</a>s of computation can access
<dfn id="INDEX7">shared memory</dfn>. No user intervention is required
to take advantage of this type of parallelism.
<p>
mental ray is also capable of exploiting thread and
<dfn id="INDEX8">process</dfn> level parallelism where multiple threads or
processes cooperate in the rendering of a single image but do not share
memory. This is done using a <dfn id="INDEX9">distributed shared database</dfn>
that provides demand-driven transparent sharing of database items on multiple
systems <a href="#FOOTNOTE1">[1]</a>. This allows parallel execution across
a network of computers for <a href="#fo:network">distributed rendering</a>.
<p>
mental ray also supports <dfn><a id="INDEX10"></a>hyperthreading</dfn> on
capable processors if enabled. Hyperthreading, introduced on Intel Pentium 4
CPUs, is a technique that runs a second thread, including a separate process
counter, on a single CPU chip to exploit otherwise idle execution units on
the chip. Since this increases memory access frequency and reduces locality
of reference, hyperthreading achieves a performance increase of only about
15-25%. Early machines with hyperthreading support are not very reliable,
so most vendors disable hyperthreading in their hardware, BIOS, or operating
system even though the CPU supports it. mental ray will not pull a license
for a hyperthreading companion thread.
</p>

<a id="fo:network"></a>
<h3>Distributed Rendering</h3>
<p>
A mental ray renderer that is started on a host to read or translate the
scene, or is executed in application software it is integrated in, may be
used as a <dfn id="fo:master">master</dfn> to utilize remote machines as
<dfn id="fo:slave">slave</dfn> renderers to contribute to the rendering of
the current image and reduce the overall rendering time. mental ray needs
to be available as a <dfn>service</dfn> on the remote machines to support
distributed rendering.
<p>
The <i>master</i> is responsible for connecting to all other machines,
assigning the rendering of a specific tile of the image to a slave,
transporting the requested scene data to the remote host, and collecting the
final results back on the master to write the complete image.
<p>
The <i>slave</i> is always tied to a specific master, message communication
and resource usage is typically managed by the master. The machine of a slave
may be used by another user at the same time; systems do not become unavailable
for other jobs if used as slaves. However, running a mental ray slave on a host
may degrade the performance of independent interactive application programs
such as modelers on that host significantly. If a slave aborts rendering, the
entire network participating in the render (the master and all slaves) will
be notified and abort as well. mental ray periodically checks the health of
all hosts on the master/slave network.
<p>
The computation of the actual rendering tasks may be pushed to the slave(s)
in the <a href="node245.html#cli:nomaster">no master</a> rendering mode.
This can be used to reduce the load and resource consumption on the master
machine, which is helpful if the master also runs front-end applications
that must remain responsive during rendering of demanding scenes.
<p>
The list of remote machines for distributed rendering can be provided to the
master in several ways.
<ul>
<li>The host names or addresses can be stored in a file named either
<tt>.ray3hosts</tt> or <tt>.rayhosts</tt>. mental ray will search for such a
file in the local directory and in the directory pointed to by the environment
variable <code>$HOME</code> (on Windows: <code>%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%</code>),
in that order. Each line contains a hostname, an optional colon-separated port
number of the service to connect to, and an optional whitespace-separated
command line parameter list that is passed to the slave upon start-up. The
first line that literally matches the name of the master host is ignored;
this allows all hosts on the network to share a single <tt>.rayhosts</tt> file,
each ignoring the first reference to itself. Empty lines or lines starting with
the comment character <code>#</code> will be skipped. Only masters ever access
the host list.
<li>
If the <a href="node245.html#cli:hosts">command line</a> option <tt>-hosts</tt>
is used to start mental ray then the <tt>.rayhosts</tt> file is ignored, and
the list of slave hosts is taken from the command line instead. In this case,
no hosts are ignored.
<li>
The integrated version of mental ray may get its host list directly set from
the application using API functions.
</ul>
<p>
Note, that master and slave can run on the same local machine. They will be
executed in separate processes which communicate through the network layer
of the system. They operate on their own copy of the database and don't share
memory. Thus, this constellation may only be useful in special cases like the
<a href="node245.html#cli:nomaster">no master</a> rendering mode.</p>

<h3>Progressive Rendering <span class="recent">3.7</span></h3>
<p>
By default, mental ray computes images by splitting them into rectangular
pieces called <dfn>tiles</dfn> which are rendered as parallel as possible to
their final quality. This is well suited for distributed rendering of larger
scenes at highest quality. It has the disadvantage that final images are
available only after all tiles have been finished.
The <dfn>progressive rendering</dfn> mode, in contrast, computes and delivers
images at full resolution with incrementally progressing quality. This
supports interactive rendering applications of mental ray with full support
for its feature set. This mode is well suited even for computationally
expensive effects like ray tracing and indirect illumination, since the first
few rendered frames will already provide a visual impression of the final
result. Users will be able to adjust their model instantaneously without the
need to wait for the complete image. Best performance can be achieved for
scenes which completely fit into the memory of the machine, coupled with
<a href="node76.html#features">feature selection</a> and rendering
<a href="node76.html#options">options</a> in mental ray that best match and
support the purpose of the rendering.

<p><span class="new">3.8</span>
Additional <a href="ibl.html#ibl_progressive">optimization techniques</a> are
available in this mode. They can be used for typical scene setup, like
illumination with <a href="ibl.html#ibl_progr_cache">IBL</a>, to accelerate
progressive rendering even further, at the expense of accuracy of certain
rendering effects which may not contribute much to the intended visual result.
<p>
Some advanced mental ray features are not supported with progressive rendering
to gain speed, see <a href="limitations.html#progressive">Known Limitations</a>.
This rendering mode can be enabled on the
<a href="node245.html#cli:progressive">command line</a> or with
<a href="node76.html#opt:progressive">scene options</a>.
<p class="note">Note, that rendering a frame in this mode is stopped when
special quality criteria are fulfilled, or a specified time limit is hit. The
default settings are very high, which basically let the render go for a very
long time before it would stop automatically.
</p>

<p><a id="FOOTNOTE1">[1]</a> The parallel
rendering technology which is required for the support of
distributed shared databases has been originally developed by
mental images as part of the ESPRIT Project 6173 <i>Design by
Simulation and Rendering on Parallel Architectures</i> (DESIRE).
