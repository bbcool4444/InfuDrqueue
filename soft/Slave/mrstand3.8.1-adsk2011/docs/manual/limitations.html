<h2 id="limitations">Known Limitations</h2>
<dl>

<dt id="ao">Ambient Occlusion
<dd>There is currently no scene selection mechanism supported to exclude
certain objects from native ambient occlusion computation. Especially, the
finalgather object and instance flags are not respected. If this is desired
final gathering may be used to calculate just the ambient occlusion
information, even if it takes longer to finish due to calling of shaders.
<dd>The native ambient occlusion cache can not be stored in files on disks.

<dt id="assembly">Assemblies
<dd>Assemblies may not update after incremental changes of their scene
representation.

<dt id="brdf">BRDF/BSDF <span class="new">3.8</span>
<dd>There is currently no support for measured BRDF data as input to a mental
ray BRDF. The BRDF/BSDF which is attached to a material is currently used to
estimate lighting distribution for direct illumination and IBL only, to
improve performance and quality. It is not used similarly in any indirect
illumination algorithm in mental ray, but instead it is point-sampled like
regular material 'black-box' shaders.

<dt id="ccmesh">Catmull-Clark Meshes
<dd>The current implementation does not support automatic splitting of large
input faces.
<dd>The current implementation does not support variable creases. If this is
needed the regular hierarchical subdivision surfaces should be used.

<dt id="framebuffer">Frame Buffer Files
<dd>For cached frame buffers, the temporary disk files are saved in 'tiled'
<code>.map</code> format which is limited to a file size of 2GB. Therefore,
a single frame buffer may not exceed this 2GB size limit. For example, the
resolution of a square 8-bit RGBA frame buffer is limited to about
23,000&nbsp;x&nbsp;23,000 pixels.

<dt id="ip">Irradiance Particles <span class="recent">3.7</span>
<dd>
Irradiance Particles cannot be used in combination with globillum photons.
mental ray will automatically adjust the rendering options on attempts to
enable incompatible features, to allow existing scenes to be rendered with
the new algorithm easily. However, Irradiance Particles are compatible with
caustic photons and final gathering.

<dt id="iray">iray Rendering Mode <span class="new">3.8</span>
<dd>
The iray rendering mode is functional but may be limited on certain platforms.
If the installed GPU hardware, graphics driver software, or CUDA software is
not capable of running iray then mental ray will execute a CPU version of the
algorithm instead, which delivers identical results but typically requires
much more time to finish.

<dt id="map">Map Data <span class="new">3.8</span>
<dd>There is currently no support for visualization of map files in image
tools, and there are no native tools available yet to manipulate map files,
for example to merge several maps into one.
<dd>
Using map data in distributed network rendering is not fully supported yet.
Although material shaders are allowed to manipulate a map at the same time
it is used during rendering, this mode currently requires special attention
in custom shaders to synchronize the map content properly. This is not
necessary in more common use cases of generating the map content prior to
rendering, like in a pre-process, a previous rendering, or by an external
application.

<dt id="metasl">MetaSL Support <span class="new">3.8</span>
<dd>The current support for MetaSL features is not completed. Two back-ends
are currently supported for software rendering on all platforms: the C/C++
back-end using an external compiler, and the LLVM back-end not depending on
external tools, and replacing the previously offered .NET back-end running
on Windows only. Most MetaSL shaders should work in the current version, but
certain advanced effects may show problems until more MetaSL features are
fully functional.

<dt id="progressive">Progressive Rendering <span class="recent">3.7</span>
<dd>In this rendering mode just the main color framebuffer is computed.
Although the traditional shading model is supported certain advanced features
implemented in shaders may not work. Especially shaders which perform
oversampling are generally not well suited for this rendering mode because
sampling cannot be controlled and optimized by mental ray. The progressive
rendering performance may suffer noticeably in such cases.

<dt id="rasterizer">Rasterizer
<dd>The order of compositing of the samples from transparent objects is
undetermined, like not using a depth-sorted ordering for example.
<dd>Visible area lights are not rendered by the rasterizer.

<dt id="stereo">Stereoscopic <span class="new">3.8</span>
<dd>The only algorithms affected by stereoscopic rendering are the "first hit"
renderers: scanline, rasterizer and tracing eye rays. Other view dependent
algorithms like final gathering, importons, or tessellation, operate as if
a single camera was used, that is they work from the "center eye". Similarly,
shaders can not determine which of the two eyes is being rendered. In particular,
<code>state->camera</code> refers to the "center eye", not the one actually
being rendered.
