<h3>Objects</h3>
<p>By default, all objects can cast and receive caustics, that is,
photons are emitted in all directions from a point light source
(and with all possible origins for a directional light source). For
some scenes, this is fine - for example if a point light source is
surrounded by specular surfaces. But for some scenes, it is very
inefficient - for example a point light far away from a single
small specular object.</p>
<p>To generate caustics more efficiently in such scenes, objects
can be flagged such that the photons are only emitted towards
certain objects and stored only on selected objects. Objects are
then divided into caustic-casting ( <tt>caustic 1</tt> flag) and
caustic-receiving (<tt>caustic 2</tt> flag), or both ( <tt>caustic
3</tt> flag), or neither (<tt>caustic 0</tt> flag). For example,
caustics on the bottom of a swimming pool require a caustic-casting
water surface and a caustic-receiving pool bottom. Objects can also
be flagged <tt>caustic off</tt>, which means that caustic photons
will not hit them at all (the objects will be "invisible" to
caustic photons), or flagged <tt>caustic on</tt> which is the same
as <tt>caustic 3</tt>. The caustic mode is an object attribute.
Photons are emitted only in the direction of caustic-casting
objects, and only stored on caustic-receiving objects.</p>
<p>To use this optimization requires that the default object
caustic flag (specified in the options) is set to something
different than 3 (which is the default value, enabling all objects
to cast and receive caustics).</p>
<p>For example, the options can contain</p>
<pre>
     caustic on
     caustic 0
</pre>
<p>The definition of a caustic-casting object can for example begin
as</p>
<pre>
     object "caster"
         caustic 1
         visible shadow reflection refraction
</pre>
<p>The material of a caustic-casting object has to be mainly
specular (little or no diffuse reflection), and for most materials,
the sum of reflection and transparency should be close to or larger
than 1. For caustics generated by
<a href="node115.html#INDEX446">refraction</a>, the
<a href="node76.html#INDEX201">index of refraction</a> has to be different
from 1. For example, the index of refraction for water is 1.33, for
glass 1.5 to 1.7, and for diamond 2.42.</p>
