    miBoolean mi_sample(
        double          *sample,
        int             *instance,
        miState         *state,
        const miUshort  dimension,
        const miUint    *n)
</pre>
<p>This is mental ray's primary generic sampling function. It can
be used to sample arbitrary functions for evaluating integrals by
deterministic sample points, which converge faster than their
random counterparts and thus reduce rendering time. The
<i><a href="node141.html#INDEX577">mi_sample</a></i> function is a high-level
easy-to-use interface hiding all mathematical details of advanced
quasi-Monte Carlo integration from the shader writer. <i>sample</i>
is an array with <i>dimension</i> members that the new sample point
will be stored into. Sample results are uniformly distributed in the
range [0,1)<sup>dim</sup>. <i>instance</i> is the current sample number;
it must point to an integer that is initialized to 0 before the first
loop iteration. If there is no loop, a null pointer may be passed.
<i>state</i> is the current shader state.
<i>dimension</i> is the dimension of the sample, such as 3 for XYZ
vectors. <i>n</i> must point to an integer that specifies the number
of samples to take. If only a single sample is taken, <i>n</i> may
be a null pointer. The body of the
<i><a href="node141.html#INDEX577">mi_sample</a></i> loop may not write to
<i>*sample</i> or <i>*n</i> or vary <i>dimension</i> between any
subsequent calls in the same loop because
<i><a href="node141.html#INDEX577">mi_sample</a></i> computes the next sample
incrementally from the previous.</p>
<p><i><a href="node141.html#INDEX577">mi_sample</a></i> has three
main applications:</p>
<ol>
<li>generating single samples, which can be used in photon and
other shaders for deciding on the kind of physical interaction like
glossy, specular, or diffuse scattering, and then selecting a new
quasi-random direction. This is the classical case of implementing
random walk simulations with the von-Neumann-Ulam scheme.</li>
<li>controlling an adaptive sampling loop, where the number of
samples is not known in advance and the sampling loop will be
terminated adaptively by the caller. This is the only mode where
the caller may and must decide when to break from the loop.</li>
<li>controlling a finite sampling loop. This is the classical case
of quasi-Monte Carlo integration, where <i>n</i> samples are drawn
and averaged. This can be used for sampling area light sources or
depth of field shaders. The advantage of knowing the number of
samples <i>n</i> in advance is an increased convergence speed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the returned sample point <i>sample</i> must be used
as <i>one</i> point. This means that several one dimensional
samples must not be assembled to yield a multidimensional sample,
and that a multidimensional sample must not be used in order to
simulate consecutive events. If, for example, 3D sampling vectors
are computed with <i><a href="node141.html#INDEX577">mi_sample</a></i>,
a single loop with
<i>dimension</i> 3 must be used, rather than a higher dimension to
obtain other sampling values at the same time, or fewer to compute
the X, Y, and Z direction separately. Samples from
<i><a href="node141.html#INDEX577">mi_sample</a></i> must be used
consecutively. The sequence should not be terminated prematurely,
nor should samples be dropped, since rejection sampling will result
in biased approximations.</p>
<p>A call to <tt>mi_sample</tt> in single sample mode looks
like:</p>
<pre>
    void a_single_sample(..., miState *state, ...)  
    {  
        double sample[2];  
             
        mi_sample(sample, 0, state, 2, 0);  
        /* use sample[0] and sample[1] */  
    }  
</pre>
<p>The sampling dimension in this example is 2. Since only a single
sample is required, no sample counting is indicated by passing a
null pointer as <tt>*instance</tt> counter and to the required
number of samples <i>n</i>. After the call to <tt>mi_sample</tt>,
the array <tt>x</tt> holds a two-dimensional sample point of
[0,1)<sup>2</sup>. The function call always returns
<tt>miFALSE</tt> in single sample mode.</p>
<p>In the adaptive sampling mode, the number of samples to be taken
is not known in advance, and the code must decide when to break
from the loop (which it may not in the other two modes, where
<i><a href="node141.html#INDEX577">mi_sample</a></i> returns
<tt>miFALSE</tt>). <i><a href="node141.html#INDEX577">mi_sample</a></i>
is then used the following way:</p>
<pre>
    void adaptive_sampling(..., miState *state, ...)
    {
        double sample[5];
        int sample_number = 0;
             
        while (mi_sample(sample, &amp;sample_number, state, 5, 0)) {
            /* use sample[0], ..., sample[4] */
            if (enough samples taken)
                break;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>Adaptive sampling is indicated to
<i><a href="node141.html#INDEX577">mi_sample</a></i> by passing a null
pointer as the number of samples <i>n</i>. The <tt>while</tt> loop is then
controlled by the <i><a href="node141.html#INDEX577">mi_sample</a></i> call,
which always returns <tt>miTRUE</tt> in adaptive sampling mode. The current
sample number starting with 1 for the first sample is kept in
<i>sample_number</i>. This variable must be initialized to zero in order to
force initialization in <i><a href="node141.html#INDEX577">mi_sample</a></i>.
Note that
in deterministic sampling, adaptive sampling (here, the <tt>break</tt>
condition) cannot be controlled by the calculation of variance as
in Monte Carlo context. This will result in biased approximations.
Adaptive sampling here could be based on contrast calculations, for
example. <i>sample</i> holds a sample point in the five-dimensional
unit cube [0,1)<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p>In the classical case, where the number of samples is known in advance,
the deterministic sampling controlled by
<i><a href="node141.html#INDEX577">mi_sample</a></i> very much resembles
a Monte Carlo quadrature:</p>
<pre>
    void finite_sampling(..., miState *state, ...)
    {
        const miUint samples = 16;
        double sample[2];
        int sample_number = 0;

        while (mi_sample(sample, &amp;sample_number, state, 2, &amp;samples)) {
            /* use sample[0], sample[1] */
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>Here, all arguments of <tt>mi_sample</tt> are used. Unlike the
previous adaptive sampling case, the number of samples is passed
explicitly to <i><a href="node141.html#INDEX577">mi_sample</a></i>.
Again the integer variable <i>sample_number</i> is initialized to
zero and passed by reference to <i>instance</i>. <i>*state</i> is
the current state of the shader.
<i><a href="node141.html#INDEX577">mi_sample</a></i> returns <tt>miTRUE</tt>
for <i>samples</i> iterations of the loop, until finally <tt>miFALSE</tt> is
returned to terminate the loop. The loop <i>should not</i> be terminated
with a <tt>break</tt> or <tt>return</tt> statement, because then the
internal state of <i>state</i> does not guarantee convergence of rendering
any longer (that is, <code>state&rarr;qmc_instance</code> and
<code>state&rarr;qmc_component</code> are wrong until the shader terminates).
In the loop, <i>*instance</i> provides the current sample number, starting
at 1, until <i>samples</i> is reached. The loop controls a two-dimensional
integration, where <i>sample</i> is an array of <tt>double</tt>s with two
elements. The vector <i>sample</i> is the sample point in the two-dimensional
unit cube [0,1)<sup>2</sup>. The finite sampling mode exposes a faster
convergence than the adaptive sampling mode.</p>
<p>
Exceptional convergence can be achieved if the number of samples is

<p>where <i>p<sub>i</sub></i> are the prime numbers, i.e.,
<i>p<sub>1</sub> = 2</i>, <i>p<sub>2</sub> = 3</i>, etc., and
<i>k<sub>i</sub></i> is a (positive) natural number. In two dimensions,
i.e., <i>dimension = 2</i>, <i>samples</i> should be a power of 2.
In the special case of <i>dimension = 1</i>, any number of samples can be
used in order to achieve optimal convergence.</p>
<p>Note that if <i><a href="node141.html#INDEX577">mi_sample</a></i>
controls the loop, it may
take fewer samples than expected. For example, consider a sun,
modeled as a disk area light source, with sampling set to request 8
samples. Assuming the sun is setting and only half of it is visible
over the horizon, sampling the lower half cannot contribute any
light. In this case, a light sampling function such as
<i><a href="node140.html#INDEX555">mi_sample_light</a></i> (which is a
specialization of <i>mi_sample</i>) may return <tt>miTRUE</tt> four
times, and then abort the loop by returning <tt>miFALSE</tt> for
the fifth call. The shader should work for such early aborts, even
if the very first call returns <tt>miFALSE</tt>. The shader should
also not assume any valid result parameters, such as
<tt>dot_nl</tt>, for a call to
<i><a href="node141.html#INDEX577">mi_sample</a></i> that has returned
<tt>miFALSE</tt>.</p>
