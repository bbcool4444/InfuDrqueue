<p>Lights have a large number of optional parameters that are used
if global illumination, caustics or shadow maps are enabled. These
techniques use a preprocessing step that analyzes how light travels
through the scene. Lights that participate in this preprocessing
stage must specify a number of extra parameters. For clarity,
regular lights and more specialized lights are shown
separately:</p>

    end light
</pre>
<p><a id="INDEX251"></a> This statement defines a
light source. All light sources need a light shader, such as the
<i>mib_light_point</i> shader in the base shader library, or
another shader linked with a <tt>code</tt> or <tt>link</tt> command
(see above). <tt>"</tt> <i>shader</i> <tt>"</tt> above stands for
the quoted name of the shader. Like any other shader, a parameter
list (possibly empty) enclosed in parentheses must be given. The
parameters depend on the particular shader; they include the light
color, attenuation, and spot light directions. The declaration of
the shader determines which parameters are available in the
<i>parameters</i> list; see section
<a href="node112.html#declaration">declaration</a> for details on shader
parameters.</p>
<p>mental ray distinguishes three kinds of light shaders:
<a href="node120.html#INDEX473">point light</a>s, giving off light in all
directions; <b><a id="INDEX252"></a>directional
light</b>s (also called <b><a id="INDEX253"></a>infinite light</b>s),
whose <b><a id="INDEX254"></a>light ray</b>s are all parallel in a particular
direction, and <a href="node120.html#INDEX475">spot light</a>s
which emit light from a point along a certain direction. Point
lights must define an <tt>origin</tt> but no <tt>direction</tt>.
Directional lights must define a <tt>direction</tt>; starting with
mental ray 3.4, they can optionally have an <tt>origin</tt> that
defines a plane whose normal is aligned with the light direction,
and behind which no light is emitted. Spot lights must define an
<tt>origin</tt>, a <tt>direction</tt>, and a <tt>spread</tt>. The
spread defines the maximum angle of the cone defined along the
direction in which the spot produces illumination. The value of
<i>spread</i> is the cosine of this maximum angle; it must be
between 1 (infinitely thin) and 0 (hemisphere). Spot lights often
use a directional attenuation, but this is purely a function of the
shader that is independent of the <tt>spread</tt> and
<tt>direction</tt> keywords in the light definition. All types of
lights can be turned into <a href="node80.html#INDEX255">area light
source</a>s.</p>
<p>After the definition, the light source can be instanced with an
<tt>instance</tt> statement that references <i>light_name</i>. The
instance can then be referenced in parameter lists of shaders (such
as a <a href="node79.html#INDEX242">material</a> shader) by listing
the light instance name. Material shaders normally have an array
parameter accepting one or more light instances, which they loop
over to accumulate the contribution by each light (unless they rely
solely on the global light list). Light instances are one of the
standard data types that are available for shader parameters. The
<i>light_name</i> should be quoted to avoid clashes with predefined
words, and to allow non-alphabetic characters.</p>
<p>A label integer can be attached to a light using the
<tt>tag</tt> statement. Labels are not used by mental ray in any
way, but a shader can use the
<i><a href="miquery.html#api:mi_query">mi_query</a></i> function to obtain the
label of a light and perform light-specific operations.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="node83.html#INDEX285">user data</a> can be
attached with a <tt>data</tt> statement. The argument must be the
name of a previously defined data element in the scene file. If the
argument is missing, a previously existing data reference is
removed.</p>
<h4>Area Light Sources</h4>
<p>Any point or spot light may be turned into an
<b><a id="INDEX255"></a>area light source</b> by naming an
<i>area_light_primitive</i>. Area light sources generate
<a href="node16.html#INDEX19">soft shadow</a>s because shadow-casting
objects may partially obscure the light source. Six types of area
light primitives are supported:</p>
<pre>
    rectangle [ <i>x<sub>0</sub> y<sub>0</sub> z<sub>0</sub> x<sub>1</sub> y<sub>1</sub> z<sub>1</sub></i> <i>sampling</i> ]
    disc [ <i>x y z</i> <i>radius</i> <i>sampling</i> ]
    sphere [ <i>radius</i> <i>sampling</i> ]
    cylinder [ <i>axis</i> <i>radius</i> <i>sampling</i> ]
    user <i>sampling</i>
    object <i>object_inst</i> <i>sampling</i>
</pre>
<p>The common <i>sampling</i> substatement is optional:</p>
<pre>
    [ <i>u_samples</i> <i>v_samples</i> [ <i>level</i> [<i>low_u_samples</i> <i>low_v_samples</i>] ]]
</pre>
<p>All three area light types are centered at the <i>origin</i>
position in the light definition. A rectangular area light is
specified by two vectors that describe the lengths of the edges; a
disc area light is specified by its normal vector and a radius; a
sphere area light is specified only by its radius; and a cylinder
area light is specified by its axis and radius. Note that the
orientation of the rectangle, disc, or cylinder are independent of
the <i>direction</i> and any directional attenuation the shader
applies, although both will generally be similar. Also note that
the end caps of the cylinder are not sampled.</p>
<p>mental ray supports a <b>user-defined area light source</b>. This
requires a special light shader that controls the points on which
it is sampled, instead of leaving the sample point location to
<i><a href="node140.html#INDEX555">mi_sample_light</a></i>.
The light shader will be called in a loop until the shader decides it
has been sampled enough, or when the sample limit
(<span class="math">u&thinsp;&middot;&thinsp;v</span>) is reached, and returns
<tt>(miBoolean)2</tt>. User area light sources also do not apply
the optimization that cancels <a href="node117.html#INDEX463">light
ray</a>s under the horizon of the illuminated point. It is not
necessary (or desirable, because of self-shadowing issues) to set
<code>state&rarr;pri</code> to null.</p>
<p>mental ray also supports <b><a id="INDEX256"></a>geometric
area light source</b>s for point lights,
specified by the <tt>object</tt> keyword. Its first argument must
be the instance of a single-group object that defines the geometry
of the area light source. All points on the surface of the object
will emit light uniformly. It is generally a good idea to keep the
triangle count of the object as low as possible for maximum
performance. The sampling rates usually have to be set much higher
for object lights.</p>
<p>The <i>u_samples</i> and <i>v_samples</i> are used to specify
the number of samples in 2 dimensions of the light area.
Quasi-Monte-Carlo sampling used by mental ray provides
stratification automatically, so the sampling patterns depend only
on the <var>u_samples * v_samples</var> product and not on the
individual values. Two values are kept for compatibility reason
only. As the implementation of the Quasi-Monte-Carlo sampling gives
the best results for the numbers which are integer power of 2, the
actual number of samples taken is the greatest power of 2 which
does not exceed <var>u_samples * v_samples</var>.</p>
<p>If the optional <i>level</i> exists and is greater than 0, then
mental ray will use <i>low_u_samples</i> and <i>low_v_samples</i>
instead of <i>u_samples</i> and <i>v_samples</i> if the sum of the
reflection and refraction trace level exceeds <i>level</i>. The
defaults for the low levels are 2. The effect is that reflections
and refractions of <a href="node16.html#INDEX19">soft shadow</a>s
are sampled at lower precision, which can improve performance
significantly. Since shaders have control over the trace level in
the state, they can influence the switching depth, which can be
used to sample soft volume shadows less precisely, for example.
This optimization does not apply to user-defined area light sources
because here the shader is in control of sampling rates, and if it
is cut off early incorrect illumination can result.</p>
<p>Like for <var>u_samples</var> and <var>v_samples</var>, only the
product of <var>low_u_samples</var> and <var>low_v_samples</var> is
relevant for the sampling pattern. In the current implementation the
actual number of samples taken is the greatest power of 2 which
does not exceed <var>low_u_samples * low_v_samples</var>.</p>
<p>If the rectangle, disc, sphere, or cylinder keyword is specified
without any of the following arguments, then the
<a href="node80.html#INDEX250">light source</a> reverts to a non-area light
source. This is useful for <a href="node60.html#INDEX110">incremental
change</a>s.</p>
<h4>Physical Correctness</h4>
<p><a id="INDEX258"></a> The second light form is
for <a href="node41.html#INDEX86">caustics</a> and
<a href="node48.html#INDEX95">global illumination</a>. (Caustics, global
illumination, and <a href="node52.html#INDEX98">final gathering</a>
implement the simulation of <b><a id="INDEX259"></a>indirect illumination</b>.) It requires
specification of the light energy. The light energy is given as an
RGB triple to allow colors, but the RGB values are typically much
higher than the usual 0&hellip;1 range for colors. The number of
photons stored from this light source in the preprocessing step is
determined by <i>store</i>, and the number of emitted photons is
determined by <i>emit</i>, if specified. When either limit is
reached, photon emission stops. If <i>store</i> is 0, <i>emit</i>
must be specified and storing is unlimited. Physical correctness
demands an <span class="math">1&thinsp;&frasl;&thinsp;r<sup>2</sup></span> power law for
energy falloff, causing the energy received from a light source to
fall off with the square of the distance to the light source.
However, the <tt>exponent</tt> parameter allows modification of the
power law to <span class="math">1&thinsp;&frasl;&thinsp;r<sup>exp</sup></span>. For any
<i>exp</i> other than <i>2</i>, physical correctness is lost, but
for achieving certain looks it is often useful to use <i>exp</i>
values between <i>1</i> and <i>2</i> to reduce the falloff, and
better approximate classical local illumination non-physically
correct lights.</p>
<p>For caustics, one can specify a <i>caustics photons</i> value
that controls the number of caustic photons stored during caustics
preprocessing. Similarly, a <i>globillum photons</i> value can be
specified for global illumination. Typical values range from 10,000
to 100,000; larger values improve accuracy and reduce
blurriness.</p>
<p>Light sources are by default invisible. However, area lights can
be made visible<a id="INDEX260"></a> by adding a
<tt>visible</tt> flag to the light. Any <tt>visible</tt> flags on
non-area lights are ignored since they have zero size. Light
visibility cannot be inherited from the instance. It reduces
performance if the number of visible lights is very large. Visible
light sources ensure that the direct contribution of the light to
the camera is not lost, and energy conservation is maintained in
the rendered image.</p>
<h4>Shadowmaps</h4>
<p>Shadow maps<a id="INDEX261"></a> are controlled
per <a href="node80.html#INDEX250">light source</a> using the
information about the light source type and the information
provided by the shadow map keywords. Shadow maps are supported for
spot lights with a cone-angle less than 90 degrees (i.e. <i>spread
&gt; 0</i>), for directional lights, and for point lights. A shadow
map is activated for a light source by specifying the
<tt>shadowmap</tt> keyword. The resolution of the shadow map which
controls the quality and also the amount of memory used is
specified with the <tt>shadowmap resolution</tt> keyword, which
specifies the width and height of the shadowmap depth buffer in
pixels. The <tt>shadowmap softness</tt> and <tt>shadowmap
samples</tt> keywords determine the type of shadow produced with
the shadow map; if the <a href="node200.html#INDEX1062">softness</a>
is zero a sharp shadow is
generated. If softness is larger than zero, <tt>shadowmap
samples</tt> different samples will be taken from the shadowmap, on
a square region the size of <tt>shadowmap softness</tt>. This will
make the boundaries of the shadows appear softer.</p>
<p>The <b><a id="INDEX262"></a>softness</b> is
specified in internal space units on the shadow map projection
plane. For directional lights, an orthographic projection is used,
so the softness will be constant in the scene, the soft region
having roughly the given softness value in size. For other lights,
because of the projective projection used, apparent softness will
increase with distance from the light. This means that much smaller
softness values are usually required for spot lights than
directional lights. If an excessively high softness value is
specified, a warning will be given during rendering. Very high
values tend to blur the shadow out of existence. The number of
samples determines the quality of the soft shadow.</p>
<p>The <a href="node200.html#INDEX1063">shadowmap bias</a>
statement specifies that mental ray should not use the distance to
the halfway point between the two closest shadow-casting objects
(this is called the <a href="node18.html#INDEX24">Woo trick</a>),
but the distance to the closest plus the <i>bias</i> value. This is
useful for <a href="node80.html#INDEX263">shadowmap merging</a>. A
<i>bias</i> value of zero re-enables the Woo algorithm. The bias
value can also set in the options; this applies to all lights.</p>
<p>If <b><a id="INDEX263"></a>shadowmap merging</b>
is enabled, mental ray will load the shadowmap file from disk, if
available, and also compute the shadowmap. It then uses the closest
distance to determine whether a point is in shadow. This is useful
in conjunction with <a href="node182.html#INDEX893">pass
rendering</a>, where the scene is divided into passes that are
rendered separately. If the objects are sorted into passes front to
back, with the frontmost rendered in the first pass, this allows
front objects to cast shadowmap shadows on objects in later passes
even though these objects are not present in the the later pass.
The merged shadowmap is saved back to the shadowmap file. Note that
<a href="node80.html#INDEX263">shadowmap merging</a> is not
compatible with the halfway-point <a href="node18.html#INDEX24">Woo
trick</a>, so it is necessary to specify a
<a href="node200.html#INDEX1063">shadowmap bias</a> either in each light
source with shadowmaps to be merged, or globally in the
<a href="node76.html#INDEX180">options block</a>. Merging does not work for
<a href="node80.html#INDEX264">detail shadowmap</a>s.</p>
<p>The <tt>shadowmap file</tt> statement can be used to specify a
shadow map file in which the shadow map will be saved the first
time it is rendered, and subsequently loaded every times it is
used. In the case of point lights, six different files will be
saved, each for a different direction (the resolution of each file
will be lower so that the total number of pixels rendered will be
approximately
<var>resolution&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;resolution</var>). If objects
in the scene move, the old shadow map files should be deleted to
prevent loading and re-using outdated shadow maps. If the filename
contains the <tt>#</tt> character, it will be expanded by mental
ray into a hash code number identifying the transformation of the
light instance. This is useful when a light is multiply instanced,
because it allows distinguishing between files representing
multiple instances of the same light. However, the user must take
care to remove obsolete files or they will eventually fill all
available disk space.</p>
<p>Shadow maps are saved in the <tt>.zt</tt> file format, which is
basically an 8-byte header followed by uncompressed floating-point
pixel data. mental ray 3.2 and later use a format variant that
works like <tt>.zt</tt> with some light space information appended.
The extra information makes loading shadowmaps for lights that have
moved, or scenes whose bounding box axes have changed, unambiguous.
This avoids a problem of switching light axes when a shadowmap is
transplanted from one scene to another.</p>
<p>For <a href="node120.html#INDEX475">spot light</a> sources, the
extent of the shadow map is determined by the <i>spread</i>
parameter. For directional light sources, the extent of the shadow
map is determined by the extent of the parts of the scene that cast
shadows. For example, in a scene with small objects on a large
background polygon, the small objects casting shadows should have a
<tt>shadow</tt> flag, while the background polygon should not. Then
the extent of the shadow map will only cover the small objects that
cast shadows. If the large background polygon also has the
<tt>shadow</tt> flag, the extent of the shadow map will be larger,
and the shadow map will lack detail at the small objects where
detailed shadows are needed.</p>
<p id="mi:shadowmap_camera">
mental ray allows attaching a camera to a spot or directional light source.
This is not the standard camera that defines the viewpoint from which the
scene is rendered; it is simply a container for the following camera fields:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>resolution</i>, if specified, overrides the shadowmap
resolution in the light source definition. It can be
nonsquare.</li>
<li>The <i>window</i> settings of the camera restricts shadowmap
sampling to the specified portion of the shadowmap. The window is
clipped to the shadowmap resolution specified in the light.</li>
<li>The <i>offset</i> settings shift the shadowmap relative to the
shadowmap plane.</li>
<li>The <i>aperture</i>, <i>focal</i>, and <i>aspect</i> values
define the field of view of the light source. The aperture is
computed from the light spread value automatically for the spot
case; it must be provided in the camera for the directional
case.</li>
</ul>
<p>All other camera fields are ignored. A light camera does not
have a camera instance; the light instance defines the necessary
transform matrix. Treating a light like a camera is an useful
abstraction for properly defining the light orientation. Note,
however, that the spread value for spot lights must still be set
and does not have a direct equivalent in the camera paradigm.</p>

<h4>Detail Shadowmaps</h4>
<p>
<a id="INDEX264"></a> A different algorithm for
calculating shadowmaps may be invoked by setting <tt>shadowmap
detail</tt>. This algorithm is a combination of standard shadowmaps
and ray traced shadows. Unlike standard shadowmaps, the detail
shadowmap algorithm invokes <a href="node121.html#INDEX481">shadow
shader</a>s at intersection points with shadow-casting
geometry.</p>
<p>The <tt>shadowmap detail samples</tt> parameter may be used to
set the number of samples per pixel taken when computing a
shadowmap pixel. A value of <i>n</i> means that
<var>n&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;n</var> samples are taken per pixel,
each involving a shadow intersection including a shadow shader call
at some varying subpixel coordinate inside the shadowmap pixel.</p>
<p>The <tt>shadowmap accuracy</tt> parameter determines how far two
depth values of a sample have to be separated in order to be
considered two distinct values. Selecting this value too small will
result in larger memory and compute resource requirements for
detail shadowmaps. Selecting it too large will lead to visible
artifacts. mental ray tries to use a reasonable default value for
the accuracy.</p>
<p><tt>shadowmap color</tt> is the default choice for detail
shadowmaps. This setting indicates that all color channels of the
shadow shader are used for the shadowmap calculation. If
<tt>shadowmap alpha</tt> is set, then only the intensity values of
the color transmission coefficients are used.</p>
<p>In general, detail shadowmaps need less resolution than standard
shadowmaps, since they may take more samples per pixel. Still,
detail shadowmaps tend to be more expensive to compute than
standard shadowmaps because of the shadow shader calls. They may
even be more expensive than raytraced shadows. However, their cost
may be offset by repeated reuse over several frames. They may also
be more efficient with time and memory resources than raytraced
shadows for motion blurred shadows.</p>
<p>The file format used to store detail shadowmaps is incompatible
with the file format used to store regular shadowmaps. The entire
file format is tile-based and only those tiles computed or used
during a rendering will be stored in the file. New tiles may be
dynamically added during rendering of new frames. Detail shadowmap
files tend to be larger than regular shadowmap files since more
information per pixel is stored.</p>
<p>Detail shadowmaps cannot be used in segmented shadow mode, and
they do not support <a href="node80.html#INDEX263">shadowmap merging</a>.
