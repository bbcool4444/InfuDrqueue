<h3 id="whatsnew">
What's new in Version 3.7</h3>

<p>Here is a summary of some of the new features and feature
improvements in version 3.7 of mental ray. Please refer to the
<a href="../relnotes/relnotes.html">release notes</a> for more
details and for other changes which are not mentioned here.</p>

<h4>Native MetaSL Shader Support</h4>
<p>
mental ray now supports shaders written in MetaSL language to be used
for software rendering. This is handled by integrated support for automatic
compilation and/or linking on the target platform, see
<a href="node99.html#sh:metasl">MetaSL shaders</a>.
<p>The shader code generation is performed by so-called MetaSL back-ends.
mental ray currently provides two back-end alternatives :</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type:decimal">
C++ back-end using an external compiler,</li>
<li style="list-style-type:decimal">
.NET back-end on Windows platforms using built-in just-in-time compilation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <strong>C++ back-end</strong> is currently the default.
<p>
The <strong>.NET back-end</strong> is optional, because it has several
<a href="limitations.html#metasl">known limitations</a> in the current
implementation. It is using the .NET Framework from Microsoft, version
2.0 or higher, available for all modern Windows platforms.
<p>
For shading trees defined in mental ray scene files, mental ray supports a first
version of shading tree <strong>flattening</strong>. This operation allows to
generate a single final shader from a source shading tree or phenomenon by
resolving all parameter connections and compilation to a composite shader.
This is possible for shading trees or phenomena which consist only of MetaSL
shaders, i.e. not mixed with C/C++ shaders. The flattening can be enabled by
setting the <code>{_MI_REG_METASL_FLATTEN}</code> mental ray registry variable
to a non-empty value.</p>

<h4>Progressive Rendering Mode</h4>
<p>
In the <a href="node6.html#fo:progressive">progressive rendering</a> mode,
the image is not rendered in tiles each
at full sampling quality any more. Instead, few samples are placed sparsely
over the full image initially and more samples are taken over time until a
desired quality is reached. During rendering the image is available for display
at any time which allows to implement interactive rendering applications with
mental ray. This mode even works with the regular but slower DISP stream
protocol that is used when connecting imf_disp to a running mental ray.
Various options allow to tune either for faster response or better quality.
The progressive rendering can be controlled to run endlessly until explicitly
stopped by the user, or until a certain sampling quality or error threshold is
reached.
<p>This version of mental ray supports traditional mental ray shaders and the
existing rendering algorithms like finalgathering (in particular, with
progressive finalgather precomputation) and photon mapping. Future versions
may provide further optimized and faster converging solutions fully based on
importance sampling and BSDFs.
<p>Progressive mode can be controlled from the
<a href="node245.html#cli:progressive">command line</a> and with
<a href="node76.html#opt:progressive">scene options</a>.

<h4>Progressive Final Gathering</h4>
<p>
The final gathering algorithm has been improved to provide much faster early
feedback which is progressively refining during the pre-computation phase,
to support interactive rendering applications based on mental ray. The tile
display ordering has been adjusted to match the tile order used during regular
rendering, giving the impression of doing a single rendering that improves
progressively. This mode can be combined with progressive rendering mode for
best interactive behavior. It has no effect with "exact" final gathering.
<p>The finalgather display during pre-computation gets enabled with the
<code>-finalgather_display on</code> command line option or with the
<code>miRENDER_DISPLAY_FG</code> bit in the rendering mode mask.
The pre-computation is now split into several passes, each one refining the
previous ones. Furthermore, it also respects the order of tile computations
specified with <code>mi_rc_set_taskorder()</code> function call.
<p>The number of FG precomputation passes can be specified with the string
option <code>"finalgather passes"</code>, or with the command line option
<code>-finalgather_passes &lt;int&gt;</code>. The default value is 3.
<p>In the current implementation, the maximal value of finalgather passes
is 8. Only 2 most recent one apply adaptivity in the raster sampling, the
purpose of others is to provide progressive rendering report. I.e. for the
number of passes larger or equal to 3 the final image does not change.
<p>For compatibility with mental ray 3.7 and prior, the single pass
finalgather display can be enabled with the string option
<code>"finalgather precomp legacy"</code>.</p>

<h4>Finalgather Point Selection</h4>
<p>For final gathering, implemented a way to restrict finalgather map lookup
to a specified subset of finalgather points. In particular, this feature may
be used for rendering of objects with multiple semi-transparent surfaces where
explicit separating of layers is more efficient than limiting interpolation
distance or increasing the density of the finalgather map.
<p>The <code>miIrrad_options</code> structure passed to
<code>mi_compute_avg_radiance()</code> function has been extended with the
integer field <code>"id"</code>. The default value for id is zero. The id
is stored with each finalgather point. For interpolation, the id passed to
the interpolation call is taken into account: if zero, all finalgather points
are potentially accepted. If non-zero, only finalgather points with the same
id are accepted.
<p>Backwards and forwards binary compatibility of mental ray shaders and
finalgather map files is maintained.</p>

<h4>Native Image Based Lighting (IBL) Support</h4>
<p>
mental ray provides a built-in solution for
<a href="ibl.html#fo:ibl">image-based lighting</a> (<strong>IBL</strong>)
with optimized performance and quality. It works for regular scenes which
have a camera environment shader installed, no matter if that shader takes
color values from a texture image or generates them procedurally. mental ray
is pre-sampling the environment and creating lookup acceleration data
structures to support importance-driven adaptive sampling during the lighting
computations in shaders. The illumination from the IBL is automatically added
to all material shaders which perform regular light sampling.
<p>The IBL mode can be controlled with
<a href="node76.html#opt:ibl">scene options</a>.
<p>IBL can be used in progressive rendering mode.</p>

<h4>Irradiance Particles</h4>
<p>
This version adds a novel and alternative global illumination technique
called <strong>Irradiance Particles</strong> (short: <strong>IP</strong>),
which is in many cases superior to finalgather and/or photon mapping in
terms of image quality, usability and performance. It is based on importons
which are shot to the scene from the camera before rendering starts. Their
hit positions with information on the amount of direct (and possibly indirect)
illumination coming at their position (hence the name "irradiance particles")
are combined into a map. Optionally, one or more passes of indirect illumination
can be computed. By the nature of the algorithm, this computation is
importance-driven. During rendering, Irradiance Particles are used to estimate
the irradiance for every shading point: if just direct illumination was
collected for irradiance particles, this is equivalent to one bounce of
indirect lighting. Irradiance can also be interpolated from precomputed
values found at nearby particle positions.
</p>

<h4>Native BRDF/BSDF Support</h4>
<p>
Support for built-in illumination models represented by a
<strong>Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function</strong>
(<strong>BSDF</strong>, commonly known as <strong>BRDF</strong> for
non-transmitting materials) has been added to mental ray. In the current
version, mental ray provides the most common <b>Lambert</b>, <b>Mirror</b>,
<b>Phong</b> and <b>Ashikhmin</b> BSDFs, as well as an <b>Architectural</b>
BSDF to closely simulate the behavior of the respective advanced mental ray
shader. More BRDF/BSDF standard models will follow in future versions.
<p>
With BSDF shaders, it is possible to omit photon shaders. For materials with a
BSDF shader but no photon shader specified mental ray automatically uses the
BSDF shader and use its <code>sample</code> function to simulate photon shader
behavior. For the future version, this fallback into BSDF will be enabled for
other indirect illumination techniques.
<p>
BSDFs may be split into up to 6 components (reflection and refraction,
with diffuse, glossy, and specular components each). The <code>eval</code>
function evaluates all BSDF components, or a subset thereof, for a pair of
incoming and outgoing directions. The <code>Bsdf</code> interface also
provides a <code>sample</code> function, which allows importance sampling
of outgoing directions for a given incoming direction. In addition, this
function provides information about the sampled component and the sample
weight. The latter can easily be combined with Russian roulette for
absorption, which could be used e.g. for writing photon shaders.
<p>A BSDF shader may be attached as material shader into
<code>miMaterial</code>. In this case, mental ray takes care of simulating
a material shader based on the BSDF.
<p>
An instance of a BSDF shader with given parameters may be specified with the
usual shader syntax. Input parameters of a BSDF shader can be specified
as the result of other shaders, allowing conventional shading trees and
phenomena to be used.
</p>

<h4>Map Container</h4>
<p>
Initial support for generalized <strong><em>Map</em></strong> containers has
been added. Maps are <em><strong>particle systems</strong></em> in N
dimensional space. Each particle has a position and set data assigned.
<p>mental ray provides functionality for creating, accessing and
editing of Maps, as well as loading them from files and saving them to files.
An efficient nearest neighbor lookup functionality is implemented, utilizing
either euclidean distance or arbitrary distance functor provided by user. The
distance functor may implement rejections by returning the
<code>miHUGE_SCALAR</code> value.
<p>
Particle data may be any structure consisting of the common types including
scalars, integers, vectors, colors and transforms. All particles in a single
map have identical layout. The position of a particle is an N-dimensional
float vector, where N varies in range from 1 to 6 in the current implementation.
<p>In this version, Maps need to be created or loaded by applications or geometry
shaders. Tutorials are added to mental ray releases.
</p>

<h4>Catmull-Clark Mesh Features</h4>
<p>
Implemented adaptive tessellation for Catmull-Clark meshes. Each region
can now have a different refinement level. t-vertices with neighbor
regions having different refinement levels are fixed with triangle fans.
Positions are always computed on the limit surface.
<p>For the Catmull-Clark meshes, improved texture seams quality by
implementing spline-rule evaluation.
</p>

<h4>Hair Approximation</h4>
<p>
Added approximation for hair. In addition to the old approximation syntax which
directly specifies the number of approximating segments, it is now
possible to specify adaptive length, distance, angle approximation
including view-dependent approximations. Parametric approximations
depending on the degree of the hair curves are supported as well.
<p>Especially for curved hair and hair at higher viewing distance, the
new approximation criterion allows to have high approximation resolution
restricted to the area where needed. The lower number of hair segments
result in reduced memory consumption and increase rendering speed.
<p>In order to get benefit from curvature-dependent approximations, hair
needs to be modelled appropriately with hair degree &gt; 1.
</p>

<h4>Motion Blur Displacement</h4>
<p>
For moving polygonal objects with displacement, added functionality to
<strong>automatically control</strong> the <strong>quality of displacement
according to the amount of visual motion</strong>. For fast moving objects,
images with comparable visual quality may be achieved with fewer displacement
tessellation details compared to static or slow moving objects. Though it is
also possible to tweak displacement approximation on a per-object basis, this
would require a lot of manual efforts and is rarely done in practice. Per-object
granularity may also be not fine enough for object having different amount of
motion in different parts. The new approximation motion factor provides an
automatic way for adjusting the displacement quality according to the amount
of motion for a given object part.</p>
<p>For view-dependent fine poly displacement the adaptive subdivision checks
motion length in screen space. The measured motion length is used to modify
the use of the approximation constant. Geometry is reduced only in areas of
the object with strong motion.</p>
<p>A new <a href="#mi:displacemotion">option</a> can be used to modify the
amount of geometry reduction compared to static case. The feature is enabled
by default at a rather conservative setting, which reduces displacement quality
only for very fast moving objects.
</p>

<h4>OpenEXR Features</h4>
<p>
For OpenEXR textures, added ability to use display window. If the registry setting
<code>_MI_OPENEXR_WINDOW</code> is set to "display" (in contrast to "data"), then
the OpenEXR display window will be used. Note that display window is not compatible
with mipmap pyramids for filtered local textures.
<p>The OpenEXR version as been updated to 1.6.1.
<p>OpenEXR library is linked statically. On an attempt to link
<code>mi_openexr.dll</code>, a warning message is printed.

<h4>Network Rendering</h4>
<p>
Added IPv6 support for mental ray multi-hosting rendering. In the
<code>.rayhosts</code> file, as well as on the command line, IPv6
addresses may be specified. Host names and IPv4 addresses are still
supported. IPv6 addresses need to be put into the ]<code>[ ]</code>
brackets following common URL convention. Note that if slave host is
specified on the command line, the <code>[ ]</code> brackets may need
encapsulation depending on the shell used.
<p>mental ray master host tries to establish connections to slaves using
either TCP or TCPv6 protocol, whatever is available and applicable to a
slave host (if a slave host is given by name, both TCP and TCPv6
protocols are tried out, the order depends on operating system used and
OS configuration).
<p>
Added IPv6 support for the socket layer of mental ray DISP protocol
(immediate display of tiles as they rendered). mental ray would listen
for connections done with either TCP or TCPv6 on the same port id. The
<code>imf_disp</code> tool would try to get the connection with any of
TCPv6 and TCP protocols.

<h3 id="mi">Scene Description Language</h3>
<p>
The following changes were made in the .mi scene description syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The .mi syntax is extended with the <code>bsdf</code> keyword, allowing to
specify the BSDF shader in the material. An instance of a BSDF shader with
given parameters may be specified with the usual shader syntax. Input
parameters of a BSDF shader can be specified as the result of other shaders,
allowing conventional shading trees and phenomena to be used.
<li>
The syntax is similar to user data elements. The layout of the map can be
declared with
<pre>
    declare map <i>"name"</i>
        [ dim <i>int</i> , ]
        <i>parameter1</i>,
        ...
        <i>parameter</i>
    end declare
</pre>
with each of parameters being one of
<pre>
    integer   "<i>parname</i>"
    scalar    "<i>parname</i>"
    vector    "<i>parname</i>"
    color     "<i>parname</i>"
    transform "<i>parname</i>"
    array <i>int</i> integer "<i>parname</i>"
    array <i>int</i> scalar  "<i>parname</i>"
</pre>
The allowed parameter types are 32-bit integers, single precision
floats, float 3d vectors, 4 component float colors and 4x4 float
matrices, as well as fixed size arrays of integers and floats.<br />
Based on a declared layout, the actual map content may be specified in
two variations as follows
<pre>
    map "<i>mapname</i>" "<i>layout</i>" (
        ["<i>mapfile1</i>", ... "<i>mapfileN</i>"]
    )
    end map

    map "<i>mapname</i>" "<i>layout</i>" (
        { &lt;<i>rec1field1</i>&gt;, ... , <i>&lt;rec1fieldM&gt;</i> },
        ....,
        { &lt;<i>recKfield1&gt;</i>, ... , <i>&lt;recKfieldM&gt;</i> }
    )
    end map
</pre>
i.e., either a list of file names containing binary map data is
specified, or the list of fields for each particles in the map.
Each <i>recSfieldT</i> entry should consist of the proper number of
space separated float or integer values. The first record in each row
should be N floats corresponding to the position of a particle in the
N-dimensional map.
<li>The <code>map</code> type has been added to the list of legal shader parameter
types, following usual conventions. However, a Map cannot be an output of a
shader.
<li>
The hair approximation can be specified on a hair object with the following
syntax:
<pre>
    approximate hair &lt;curve_approx&gt;
</pre>
with <code>&lt;curve_approx</code>&gt; being any curve approximation
technique, for example:
<pre>
    approximate hair view length 3 distance 0.1 angle 5 0 7
</pre>
<li id="mi:displacemotion">
Added new string option<code>"geom displace motion factor" f</code> used to
modify the amount of geometry reduction compared to static case. A factor of
<code>f=0</code> turns off the feature. The factor <code>f=1</code> is the
current default to achieve a reasonable compromise between quality and speed.
Higher values of <code>f</code> give more reduction. The current default value
is rather conservative: the simplification of geometry will have an effect for
motion of approximately 16 pixels. In order to get effect on slower motion,
higher values should be used. For example, the factor value of 8 would reduce
geometry in areas of objects moving at the speed of 2 pixels per frame.
<li>
Added a new string option <code>"importon emitted"</code>. If specifies
the total number of importons to emit and overrides the <code>"importon
density"</code> string option. The options are similar, but
<code>"importon emitted"</code> specifies the value which is independent
of the image resolution and thus is better for tuning.</li>
<li>
Added a new .mi syntax
<pre>
    rename "target" "source"
</pre>
This function may be used to rename existing scene entities.
See the related <a href="#api:rename">API function</a> for further details.
<li id="mi:triestimate">
Added new object flag "<code>triangle estimate &lt;int&gt;</code>" to the .mi
syntax. This field may be set by a translator or exporter and give approximate
number of triangles expected for the given object. CAD application frequently
would know the precise number, but even if it is know only up to an order of
magnitude it is advisable to provide it. In the future versions, mental ray
will use it as a hint for optimizing performance and memory usage.
<li>
Add new combined approximation style for shared displacement without
Hermite blending. The displacement approximation styles syntax includes
now <code>"fine shared"</code>, <code>"fine nosmoothing"</code>, and
<code>"fine shared nosmoothing"</code>. The registry key
<code>_MI_REG_SHARED_DISPLACEMENT</code> which could be used to enabled the
"shared" mode globally for all objects is <strong>deprecated</strong>, but
could be used in mental ray 3.7 for compatibility reasons.
<li>
Removed obsolete syntax and API interface for implicit patches.
</ul>

<h3 id="shader">Shader Writing and Integration</h3>
<ul>
<li>
The <code>miMaterial</code> structure has been extended with a <code>bsdf</code>
slot, which may specify an instance of an optional BSDF shader.
<li>
A material shader may access the BSDF attached to the current shading
state by using <code>mi::shader::Access_bsdf</code> class. The API for
interaction with BSDFs is declared in the new <code>shader_bsdf.h</code>
header file. It is described in the doxygen documentation in the manual.
<li>
mental ray provides built-in <code>builtin_bsdf_architectural</code> and
<code>builtin_bsdf_mirror</code> BSDFs.
The <code>builtin_bsdf_architectural</code> is a simplification of the
architectural material, containing the parameters relevant for the material
properties. The <code>builtin_bsdf_mirror</code> is a simple specular
reflection, which multiplies the reflected color with the
<code>reflection</code> parameter.
<li>
mental ray provides a built-in compatibility version of the architectural
bsdf. Its functionality is the same as for the
<code>builtin_bsdf_architectural</code>, but the declaration follows those
of the architectural material. This BSDF may be used to minimize changes to
the existing scenes and translators using the architectural material.
<li>API functionality for the Map container is provided with the
<code>mi_api_map_*</code> functions family.
<li id="api:rename">
Added a new function
<pre>
    mi_api_rename(char *target, char *source)
</pre>
to rename existing scene entities without recreating them. In particular this
may be used by application interface to follow user interaction. The function
has following limitations:
<ul>
<li>Renaming across scopes is not supported, by design.
<li>Compatibility with <strong>incremental</strong> echo is limited.
mental ray kernel does not maintain list of renaming. If re-namings
are done and scene changes are echoed, application should print a set
of rename commands as previously echoed parts of the scene may
contain old names.
<li>API notify callback is not called for the function.
<li>Renaming phenomenon/shader GUI elements is not supported.
<li>Renaming of shader declarations is possible but discouraged as
corresponding functions are linked using the same name as in the
shader declaration.
</ul>
<li>
Added the new member field <code>miObject::tri_est</code>, to provide an
estimate of triangulation counts. See <a href="#mi:triestimate">scene
syntax</a> description for more details.
<li>mental ray code has been switched to use STLPORT compiled in the
proprietary namespace MISTD. This resolves potential symbol conflicts for
integrating application and 3rd party plug-ins; requirements on the
compiler compatibility / version match are reduced.
<li>
The <code>miAPPROX_STYLE_FINE_NO_SMOOTHING_CONT_DISP</code> value has been
added to the <code>miApprox_style</code> enumeration.
<li>
For the integrated versions of raylib, the emergency exit for
renderings running out of memory has been modified. The function
<code>mi_rc_run</code> now returns to the application in one second and
does not wait until all rendering threads are blocked. The rendering
threads are still blocked on memory or database operations, possibly
after <code>mi_rc_run</code> returns. Previous synchronous mode where
<code>mi_rc_run</code> returned first after all threads get blocked was
less robust: threads blocked on internal locks were not counted, which
resulted in a possible application freeze.
<li>
Added a new type for progress message in ambient occlusion computation pass.
<li>Extended progress strings enum with Irradiance Particles entry.
<li>Added Irradiance Particles entry to the <code>mi_query</code> mode
<code>miQ_STAGE</code>.
<li>
For string options, allow shader to access boolean values as integers.
This is handy if shaders use variables of type <code>miBoolean</code>,
which is typedefed to int.
<li>
Size argument taken by memory allocation functions is now of type
<code>unsigned</code>.
</ul>

<h3 id="incompatible">Incompatible Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>miMaterial</code> structure has been extended with bsdf slot.
<li>
The layout of <code>miHair_list</code> structure has been extended with
approximation. Unused integer approximation has been removed.
<li>
The content of <code>mi_shader_if.h</code> header file now include
several partial header files according to the features if the
<code>mi::shader::Interface</code> class. Shader writers are still
supposed to include the <code>mi_shader_if.h</code> file into the shader
C++ files.
<li>
The shader interface is now defined in the <code>mi::shader_v3</code>
namespace. A namespace alias for <code>mi::shader</code> is added, so
that no changes to the shader code are required. Shader writers are
expected to continue to use the <code>mi::shader</code> namespace.
This fixes possible crashes (mismatched symbol linkage) in debug shader
libraries using different versions of <code>mi::shader::Access_fb</code>
or <code>Edit_fb</code> classes from different versions in the same
rendering.
<li>
The <code>mi::shader::Interface</code> version has been increased to 3.
Shaders compiled for mental ray 3.7 alpha versions need to be recompiled.
Shaders compiled for mental ray 3.6/3.6+ keep the limited binary
compatibility with mental ray 3.7 over the
<code>mi::shader::Interface</code> version 2.
<li>Removed obsolete syntax and API interface for implicit patches.
<li>Removed obsolete box type from the <code>miGeoBox</code> structure.
</ul>
