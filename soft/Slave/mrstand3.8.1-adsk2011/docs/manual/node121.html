<h2>Shadow Shaders</h2>
<p><a id="INDEX481"></a> As described in the
previous section, light shaders may trace shadow rays between the
light source and the point to be illuminated. When this ray hits an
occluding object, that object's shadow shader is called, if
present. (If the object has no shadow shader, the object is assumed
to block all light.) Shadow shaders accept an input color that is
dimmed according to the <a href="node76.html#INDEX200">transparency</a>
and color of the occluding
object. If the resulting color is black, that is, if the object is
fully opaque, the shadow shader should return <tt>miFALSE</tt>.</p>
<p>If there is more than one occluding object between the
<a href="node80.html#INDEX250">light source</a> and the illuminated point,
the order in which the shadow shaders of the occluding objects are
called is undefined, unless shadow sorting or segmented shadows are
turned on. Shadow shaders that rely on being called in the correct
order, the one closest to the light source first, should define
<tt>shadow sort</tt> in their shader declaration to ensure that
shadow sorting is enabled if the shader is used.</p>
<p>Shadow shaders should check for shadow segment mode. If <a href="node102.html#INDEX391">shadow segments</a> are turned on, shadow
shaders must behave rather differently, similar to computing
transparency in material shaders. The shadow ray points from the
previous intersection (or the illumination point for the initial
segment) to the current intersection point. It should set up
<tt>state-&gt;refraction_volume</tt> for the next shadow segment,
obtain the illumination by calling
<b><a id="INDEX482"></a>mi_trace_shadow_seg</b>, and then apply the
usual modifications.</p>
<p>Shadow shaders should distinguish two cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>state-&gt;options-&gt;shadow</tt> is <tt>1</tt> or
<tt>'l'</tt><br />
<br />
All shadow ray origins are at the light source, and their
intersection point is on the intersection object whose shadow
shader was called. The <i>mi_trace_shadow</i> call by the light
shader calls all shadow shaders.</li>
<li><tt>state-&gt;options-&gt;shadow</tt> is <tt>'s'</tt><br />
<br />
Shadow rays travel in the opposite direction and form a chain from
the illuminated point towards the light source. Each shadow ray's
origin is the previous ray's end point. The shadow shader must
perform inside/outside calculations and leave the correct <a href="node117.html#INDEX460">volume shader</a> in
<tt>state-&gt;volume</tt>. The <i>mi_trace_shadow</i> call by the
<a href="node120.html#INDEX471">light shader</a> only calls the
first shadow shader closest to the illuminated point; that shadow
shader must call <i>mi_trace_shadow_seg</i> after choosing the
volume.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a new <a href="node115.html#INDEX440">material shader</a> is
written, it is often necessary to also write a matching <a href="node121.html#INDEX481">shadow shader</a>. The shadow shader
performs a subset of the calculations done in the material shader:
it may evaluate textures and transparencies, but it will not sample
lights and it will not cast secondary rays (other than shadow rays
in shadow segment mode). The shader writer can either write a
separate shadow shader, or let the <a href="node115.html#INDEX440">material shader</a> double as shadow shader
by building the scene such that the material shader appears twice
in the material definition. Most shaders take the latter approach.
It relies on the material shader to omit all calculations that are
necessary only in the material shader when called as a shadow
shader. The shader can find out whether it is called as a material
shader or as a shadow shader by checking if <i>state</i>&rarr;type
is <tt>miRAY_SHADOW</tt>: if yes, this is a shadow shader.</p>
<p>The following shadow shader is a separate shader that attenuates
the light that passes through the object based on two shader
parameters, the diffuse color and the transparency. Material
shaders usually also have ambient and specular colors, but the best
approach is to pass the diffuse color to shadow shaders because it
describes the "true color" of the object best. Note that the scene
can be arranged such that although the shadow shader is separate
from the material shader, it still gets a copy of the material
shader's <a href="node65.html#INDEX142">shader parameter</a>s so
the shadow shader can access the "true" material parameters. In a
.mi file, this is done by declaring the shadow shader with no
parameters and naming none in the <tt>shadow</tt> statement in the
material definition (just give <tt>()</tt>). This sharing of
parameters even if the shader itself is not shared avoids having to
duplicate a large set of parameters.</p>
<pre>
    miBoolean myshadow(
        miColor         *result,
        miState         *state,
        struct myshadow *paras)
    {
        miScalar        opacity;
        miScalar        f, omf;

        if (state-&gt;options-&gt;shadow == 's') {
                set up state-&gt;refraction_volume;
                if (!mi_trace_shadow_seg(result, state))
                        result-&gt;r = result-&gt;g = result-&gt;b = 0;
        }
        opacity = 1 - *mi_eval_scalar(&amp;paras-&gt;transp);
        if (opacity &lt; 0.5) {
                f = 2 * opacity;
                result-&gt;r *= f * diffuse.r;
                result-&gt;g *= f * diffuse.g;
                result-&gt;b *= f * diffuse.b;
        } else {
                f = 2 * (opacity - 0.5);
                omf = 1 - f;
                result-&gt;r *= f + omf * diffuse.r;
                result-&gt;g *= f + omf * diffuse.g;
                result-&gt;b *= f + omf * diffuse.b;
        }
        return(result-&gt;r != 0 || result-&gt;g != 0 || result-&gt;b != 0);
    }
</pre>
<p>In non-segmented shadow mode, the <i>org</i> variable in the
state always contains the position of the light source responsible
for casting the shadow rays. The <tt>point</tt> state variable
contains the point on the shadow-casting object. The <i>dist</i>
state variable is the distance to the light source (except for
directional lights, which have no origin). In shadow segment mode,
shadow rays travel in the opposite direction; <i>org</i> is the
previous intersection (or the illumination point for the initial
segment), and <i>dir</i> points towards the light source.</p>
