<h1>Ray Type Switching Shaders</h1>
<p>
<h2 id="Generic_Switchers">Generic Switchers</h2>
<p>
The <i>mip_rayswitch</i> and <i>mip_rayswitch_advanced</i> utility 
shaders allows different types of rays to return different results. 
There are many cases in which this can be useful, including but not 
limited to:
<br />
<ul>

<li> Separating primary and secondary rays into calls to other shader.
<li> Returning a different environment to eye rays (i.e. a photographic
      background plate for screen background), reflection rays (i.e. a
      spherical high resolution environment to be seen in reflections)
      and final gather rays (a filtered environment suitable for lighting
      the scene).
<li> Limiting time consuming shaders where they are nearly invisible 
      (avoiding a complicated secondary illumination or ambient occlusion
      shader in the refractions seen through frosted glass)
</ul>

<p>
The <i>mip_rayswitch</i> shader is a simple shader that accepts a 
set of other colors (generally set to other subshaders) to apply for 
certain classes of rays.
<p>
<pre>
declare shader "mip_rayswitch" (
        color  "eye",
        color  "transparent",
        color  "reflection",
        color  "refraction",
        color  "finalgather",
        color  "environment",
        color  "shadow",
        color  "photon",
        color  "default"
    )
    version 1
    apply material, texture, environment
end declare
</pre>
<p>
For primary rays, <b>eye</b> sets the result for eye rays.
<p>
For secondary rays, <b>transparent</b> is the result for 
transparency rays, <b>reflection</b> for reflection rays 
and <b>environment</b> for environment rays.
<p>
The <b>finalgather</b> is the result for final gather rays
as well as child rays to final gather rays.
<p>
Similarly, <b>shadow</b> is the result for shadow rays, 
<b>photon</b> catches all photon rays. 
<p>
Finally, the <b>default</b> is the result for any other
ray type. It is not a fall-through default, however, each
of the above returns their respective result whether connected
to a shader or not (i.e. generally 0 0 0 0 black).
<p>
If one wants fall-through defaults, one must use the advanced 
version of the shader:
<p>
<pre>
declare shader "mip_rayswitch_advanced" (
        shader "eye",
        shader "transparent",
        shader "reflection",
        shader "refraction",
        shader "finalgather",
        shader "environment",
        shader "any_secondary",
        shader "shadow",
        shader "photon",
        shader "default"
    )
    version 1
    apply material, texture, environment
end declare
</pre>
<p>
This shader works very similar to <i>mip_rayswitch</i>, but
instead of accepting inputs of type &quot;color&quot;, it accepts inputs
of type &quot;shader&quot;.
<p>
While this no longer allows assigning a fixed color directly, it
instead allows <em>fall-through defaults</em>.
<p>
Each of the parameters works in a similar way: <b>eye</b> is
the shader for eye rays, <b>transparent</b> for transparency
rays, <b>reflection</b> for reflection rays, <b>refraction</b>
for refraction rays, etc.
<p>
The difference is if one of these shaders are <em>not specified</em>, 
one of the fall-through cases take over. If either of the specific 
secondary ray type shaders are not specified, and a ray of that 
type arrives, the <b>any_secondary</b> acts as a catch-all 
for all the secondary ray types not explicitly set.
<p>
Similarly, the <b>default</b> parameter works as a catch all
for every unspecified shader above it.
<p>
<h2 id="Environment_Switcher">Environment Switcher</h2>
<p>
A classical issue one runs into with mental ray is that there is simply
a single concept of &quot;the environment&quot;, whereas one often, in practical
use, wants to separate the concept of a <em>background</em> to that of
an <em>environment</em>.
<p>
This shader accomplishes exactly that:
<p>
<pre>
declare shader "mip_rayswitch_environment" (
        color   "background"  default 0 0 0 0,
        color   "environment" default 0 0 0 0,
    )
    apply texture, environment
    version 1
end declare
</pre>
<p>
The shader returns <b>background</b> for any eye ray, transparency
ray that is a child of an eye ray, or any refracted ray that travels
in the same direction as said transparency ray would (i.e. rays of type
miRAY_REFRACT, but that was refracted by an IOR of 1.0 and is a direct
child of an eye ray).
<p>
For any other type of rays (reflection, refraction, final gathering etc.)
the shader returns the <b>environment</b> color.
<p>
The shader is intended to be used as the camera environment, but will 
function anywhere in a shading graph as a ray switching node, in many 
cases where one need to distinguish between &quot;primary&quot; and 
&quot;secondary&quot; rays.
<p>
For example, this is the ideal shader to switch between primary-
and secondary rays to support the &quot;best of both worlds&quot; usage 
of <i>mip_matteshadow</i> described on page 
<a href="prod_mattecamera.html#Best_of_both_worlds">Best-of-both-worlds</a>.
<p>
<h2 id="Render_Stage_Switcher">Render Stage Switcher</h2>
<p>
Sometimes one desires to use different colors or subshaders depending
on where in the rendering pipeline mental ray is. For example, one may
wish to make a certain material completely opaque to final gather
rays, or for a light to have a different color while emitting photons,
or similar.
<p>
<pre>
declare shader "mip_rayswitch_stage" (
        color "unknown",
        color "main_render",
        color "finalgather_precomp",
        color "ao_precomp",
        color "caustic_photons",
        color "globillum_photons",
        color "importon_emit",
        color "lightmapping"
    )
    version 1
    apply material, texture, environment
end declare
</pre>
<p>
The parameters all work in a similar way to all the other switcher shaders.
<p>
<b>unknown</b> is for any &quot;unknown&quot; stage. This should normally never be
called, but exists as a safety precaution to safeguard against
any new rendering stages introduced in future mental ray versions that are
unknown at this time.
<p>
During the normal tile rendering pass, the shader returns the value of 
the <b>main_render</b> input.
<p>
During finalgather precomputation phase, the shader returns the value of 
<b>finalgather_precomp</b>.
<p>
During ambient occlusion precomputation phase, the shader returns the 
value of <b>ao_precomp</b>. Note that mental ray 3.7 does not call shaders
at all during this phase, so this will never be called - but future versions
of mental ray may act differently.
<p>
During caustic and global illumination photon tracing, the values for 
<b>caustic_photons</b> and <b>globillum_photons</b> inputs are
used respectively.
<p>
During the importon emission phase, the value from <b>importon_emit</b> is used.
<p>
Finally, during the light mapping preprocessing phase (used, for example, by
the subsurface scattering shaders) the value in <b>lightmapping</b> is used.
