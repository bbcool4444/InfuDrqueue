<h1>Matte/Shadow Objects and Camera Maps</h1>
<p>
<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
Often one wants to include synthetic<a href="#Foot1" title="When we use the term &quot;synthetic&quot; we mean additional objects to be inserted in the scene, and &quot;real world&quot; for objects that are already there. "><sup>1</sup></a> objects into an existing
photographic background plate filled with real world objects,
for example, adding a yet-to-be-constructed building into an 
empty lot, adding a virtual car onto a road, or having a virtual
character walk through a scene and realistically interact with
objects in the real world scene.
<p>
Two main shaders exists to facilitate this, <i>mip_cameramap</i>,
which &quot;projects&quot; an image from the camera onto geometry, and
<i>mip_matteshadow</i> which takes care of generating hold-out
mattes, as well as allowing the real world objects in the 
photographic plate both cast and receive shadows, as well as 
receive reflections and indirect light.
<p>
<h2 id="mip_cameramap">mip_cameramap</h2>
<p>
This shader is used to look up a color texture based on the surface 
points on-screen pixel coordinate. The shader is similar in function to 
<b>mib_lookup_background</b> from the <code>base</code> library, 
but with the following important differences:
<br />
<ul>

<li> The coordinate being looked up is the true &quot;back transformation&quot;
      of the shading point into raster space, rather than just the
      current rendered pixels raster position.
      This means that the background is correctly seen in reflections
      and refractions.
<li> It can perform a &quot;per pixel&quot; match, avoiding blurring of the 
      background due to interpolation.
</ul>

<p>
<pre>
declare shader "mip_cameramap" (
        color texture "map",
        scalar  "multiplier"               default 1.0,
        scalar  "degamma"                  default 1.0,
        boolean "per_pixel_match"          default off,
        boolean "transparent_alpha"        default off,
        boolean "offscreen_is_environment" default on,
        color   "offscreen_color"
    )
    version 4
    apply material, texture, environment
end declare
</pre>
<p>
The <b>map</b> parameter is a color texture to be looked up,
and <b>multiplier</b> a multiplier for that map. 
<p>
If necessary, the shader can apply an inverse gamma correction to
the texture by the <b>degamma</b> parameter. If gamma is handled
by other shaders in the chain, or if the global mental ray gamma 
is used, use a value of 1.0, which means &quot;unchanged&quot;.
<p>
When <b>per_pixel_match</b> is off, the texture is simply stretched
to fill the scene exactly. When <b>per_pixel_match</b> is on, the 
lower left pixel of the map is exactly matched to the lower left rendered
pixel. If the pixel size of the map and the pixel size of the rendering 
is different a warning is printed, but the image is still rendered 
although the image will be cropped/padded as needed.
<p>
Sometimes one wants the shader applied as a background, but still want
to extract information from the alpha channel. 
If <b>transparent_alpha</b> is on, the alpha values is always zero.
If it is off, the alpha value from the texture is used.
<p>
The shader performs a true &quot;reverse transform&quot; of the shading 
point into raster space. While this by necessity results in an on-screen
location for eye rays, this is not so for reflections, refractions etc.
These rays may hit a point on the object which is off screen. If
the <b>offscreen_is_environment</b> is on, these rays will return
the environment. If it is off, the <b>offscreen_color</b> is
returned. In either case, this color is <em>not</em> affected by neither
the <b>multiplier</b> nor <b>gamma</b>.
<p>
<h2 id="mip_matteshadow">mip_matteshadow</h2>
<p>
This shader is used to create &quot;matte objects&quot;, i.e. objects who
is used to &quot;represent&quot; existing real world objects in an existing 
photographic plate, for the purposes of...
<br />
<ul>

<li> ...blocking another synthetic object from the cameras view 
         (to allow the synthetic objects to go behind the real world object).
<li> ...allowing synthetic objects to cast shadows and occlusion on 
         and receive shadows from the real world objects.
<li> ...adding reflections of synthetic objects onto real world objects.
<li> ...allow the interplay of indirect light between synthetic and real 
         world objects.
</ul>

<p>
In all above cases the <i>mip_matteshadow</i> is applied to an object
<em>representing</em> the real world object, and the synthetic object is
using a traditional material.
<p>
The shader can also function as a &quot;shadows only&quot; shader, i.e. a shader
which only shows how much in shadow a point is compared to the incoming
light, but ignoring the actual amount of incoming light itself (only the
occluded percentage of it).
<p>

<p>
<em>NOTE:</em> This section will only <b>briefly</b> lists the parameters 
and the section &quot;usage tips&quot; on page <a href="prod_mattecamera.html#matteuseagetips">matteuseagetips</a> gives an in 
depth explanation of different use cases.
<p>
The shader has multiple outputs (it returns a struct). However, by default
(for compatibility reasons) it only fills in the first item of the struct,
the compound &quot;result&quot;. Only if the parameter <b>multiple_outputs</b> is
enabled are the separate results written to the other outputs.
<p>
The <b>background</b> parameter is the background color. If neither of the
<b>catch_...</b> options are on, this result is simply returned, including
its alpha, and the shader does nothing. Otherwise it is the base color upon
which all the other operations occur. When using external compositing this is 
generally transparent black (0 0 0 0), otherwise one would use the real 
world background plate mapped with the <i>mip_cameramap</i> shader.
<p>
The <b>catch_shadows</b> option enables other objects to cast shadows
on this object. 
<p>
The <b>shadows</b> parameter is the color of the shadows. When shadows 
are detected, a blend between <b>background</b> and <b>shadows</b>
depending on how much &quot;in shadow&quot; the point is.
<p>
The <b>ambient</b> parameter sets a &quot;base light level&quot;. It raises the
lowest &quot;in shadow&quot; level. For example, if this is 0.2 0.2 0.2 the darkest
shadow produced will be an 20 percent blend of <b>background</b> to a 80 
percent blend of <b>shadow</b> (unless ambient occlusion is enabled).
<p>
Turning on the <b>no_self_shadow</b> option (and also using an
instance of the shader as shadow shader) causes any object using 
<i>mip_matteshadow</i> not to receive shadows on any 
other such object.
<p>
The <b>use_dot_nl</b> option defines if the angle to the light is 
considered when calculating the incoming amount or not. 
<p>
If <b>color_shadows</b> is 0.0, all shadows are cast in gray scale.
If it is 1.0, the shadows have full color. For example, if the surface 
is lit by one red and one green light, the red light will have a green 
shadow, and the green light will have a red shadow.
<p>
If <b>ao_on</b> is enabled, a built in <em>Ambient Occlusion</em> 
(henceforth simply called &quot;AO&quot;) is applied based on the color in
the <b>ambient</b> parameter. The AO respects the 
<b>no_self_shadow</b> switch and will not cause AO from objects 
with the same material instance as itself.
<p>
The <b>ao_dark</b> parameter decides how dark shadows the AO
will cause. The default black is generally adequate, but a lighter
color will cause a less pronounced shading effect. 
<p>
<b>ao_samples</b> number of AO rays are shot. One can limit the reach
of the AO rays with the <b>ao_distance</b> parameter. If it is zero,
the rays reach infinitely far. Short rays increase performance dramatically
but localizes the AO effect.
<p>
The <b>catch_reflections</b> turns on reflections. 
<p>
The <b>refl_color</b> is the multiplier for reflections. Note that
the alpha value of this color is important in that the reflections will
influence the alpha by this amount. In some cases the reflections may
need to be subtractive, in which case <b>refl_subtractive</b> is 
used -  see page <a href="prod_mattecamera.html#matteuseagetips">matteuseagetips</a> for details.
<p>
The <b>refl_samples</b> parameters sets the number of glossy
reflection samples. If it is zero, mirror reflections are used.
Otherwise the <b>refl_glossiness</b> sets the ward glossiness
for reflections.
<p>
Reflections are seen at most <b>refl_max_dist</b> and the shape
of the falloff is <b>refl_falloff</b>, very similar like the 
<code>base</code> library's shader <b>mib_glossy_reflection</b>.
<p>
If the option <b>catch_indirect</b> is enabled, indirect light is
gathered and scaled by the <b>indirect</b> color (which one generally
sets to the same as the <b>background</b> color, thereby treating the 
background color as a reflectance value for the indirect light).
<p>
The <b>multiple_outputs</b> causes the shader to output more than
a single value in the returned struct.
<p>
If the <b>catch_illuminators</b> switch is on, the lights listed
as <b>illuminators</b> are tested and allowed to actually light 
the scene. This is a simple Lambertian illumination treating the 
<b>background</b> parameter as the diffuse color<a href="#Foot2" title="The difference between lights and illuminators is that the lights are only used to cause shadows on the background, whereas the illuminators are used to throw actual light on it. This means that the lights array should contain lights which are already present in the background plate, and the illuminators array contains any additional lights introduced by a CG element, for example the headlights of a CG car. "><sup>2</sup></a>.
<p>
The <b>additional_color</b> is a color input simply added to the
result, for easy shader graph construction. It can be used for anything<a href="#Foot3" title="For example to add a specular highlight to an illuminator by plugging in a mib_illum_phong with it's diffuse color set to black. "><sup>3</sup></a>.
<p>
Finally, <b>mode</b> sets the light inclusion/exclusion mode and 
<b>lights</b> is the light list used for casting shadows, just like in 
many other shaders.
<p>
The shader also has <em>multiple outputs</em>. For compatibility, the shader
does not actually write any values to anything but the main output if the
<b>multiple_outputs</b> parameter is not on. But if this parameter is
enabled, the shader outputs the following values:
<br />
<ul>

<li> <b>result</b> - the compound result.
<li> <b>shadows_raw</b> - the raw full-color shadow pass on white
background, suitable for compositing on top of a background in &quot;multiply&quot; mode.
<li> <b>ao_raw</b> - the raw ambient occlusion.
<li> <b>refl_raw</b> - the raw reflections
<li> <b>indirect_raw</b> - the indirect light arriving
<li> <b>illumination_raw</b> - light gathered from any lights in the
<b>illuminators</b> list.
</ul>

<p>
All outputs are as &quot;raw&quot; as possible to be maximally useful as layers in post production, 
e.g. the reflections have not been multiplied with the reflection color, etc.
<p>
<h2 id="mip_matteshadow_mtl">mip_matteshadow_mtl</h2>
<p>
This is a <em>material phenomena</em> that embeds <i>mip_matteshadow</i>, and 
applies it as surface, shadow and photon shader for a material. It has the same
parameters as <i>mip_matteshadow</i> itself, plus a scalar <b>opacity</b>.
<p>
The opacity does not apply to the shadows or photons, but only to the visible 
surface shading itself. By using the opacity, one can use painted masks 
for irregular edges. For example, use a simple tapered cylinder to roughly 
match a forearm, and use a camera-projected mask (applied with the help of 
<i>mip_cameramap</i>) for the actual contours of the arm. This also
allows matching motion blur that may be present in the background plate
with the help of masks.
<p>

<h2 id="Usage_Tips">Usage Tips</h2>
<p>
The shaders in this section are concerned with combining a real 
world photographic plate with synthetic objects. For the sake of
our examples, we are basing them on the following <em>photograph</em> 
of a kitchen counter, with an old beat up plastic salt shaker,
a spice jar, a piece of paper, and some other things on it:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/prod-bg-only.jpg" alt="This is our background photograph. This is not a rendering... yet."><br />This is our background photograph. This is not a rendering... yet.
</div>
<p>
<h3 id="Camera_Mapping_Explained">Camera Mapping Explained</h3>
<p>
What is the difference between <i>mip_cameramap</i> and the 
<i>mib_lookup_background</i> from the <code>base</code> library? 
<p>
The main difference is 
that the former only uses the current raster position (i.e. x and y
coordinate of the pixel currently being rendered) whereas the 
latter actually calculates the image space position of the shaded 
point.
<p>
Why does that matter? Lets try an example. See the following example 
of reflective sphere on top of a background photograph mapped to a 
flat plane using the two different shaders:
<div class="pic">
<img width="80%" src="images/prod-cammap-wrong.jpg" alt="mib_lookup_background"><br />mib_lookup_background<br /><img width="80%" src="images/prod-cammap-right.jpg" alt="mip_cameramap"><br />mip_cameramap<br /></div>
<p>
Notice how the left image, which uses <i>mib_lookup_background</i> 
looks incorrect. It looks transparent rather than reflective. What
is the cause of this?
<p>
Imagine we are rendering pixel coordinate 200,200 which lies on the 
sphere. An eye ray is sent that hits the sphere. This hit point is
indeed on the 200,200 pixel coordinate. But the ray continues
as a reflection ray to hit the ground plane. 
<p>
This new point (on the ground plane) is not the same as the pixel being 
rendered, it is somewhere else in the model. 
Yet <i>mib_lookup_background</i> only concerns itself with the current
pixel (200,200) and will return the color at that point from the map.
<p>
Conversely, <i>mip_cameramap</i> actually converts this <em>new</em>
point to a new set of raster coordinates (e.g. 129,145) and will
look up the map at that <em>new</em> position, creating the correct
appearance in the reflection.
<p>
However, there is a snag; what happens if the reflected point lies
<em>outside the screen</em>? What if the calculated raster coordinate is 
(-45, 39)? The answer is that <i>mip_cameramap</i> either returns the
specified color, or, if <b>offscreen_is_environment</b> is on, 
returns the environment color for that ray direction.
<p>
<h3 id="Matte_Objects_and_Catching_Shadows">Matte Objects and Catching Shadows</h3>
<p>
In this section we will use <i>mip_matteshadow</i> to create 
stand-in objects (also known as &quot;matte objects&quot;) for real world
geometry. For the example we only concern ourself with the old
plastic salt shaker on the left of the image, and the kitchen
counter itself. The following simple 3D model has been constructed:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/prod-gb-gray.jpg" alt="The simple 3D model of our background"><br />The simple 3D model of our background
</div>
<p>
If we are <em>not</em> using <i>mip_matteshadow</i> and for example
simply attempt to map our background to a standard Lambertian surface
we get the following result:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/prod-bg-lambert.jpg" alt="Mapping the background onto a Lambert shader"><br />Mapping the background onto a Lambert shader
</div>
<p>
Clearly unsatisfactory, since Lambertian shading is applied on
top of shading already present in the real world image. What
we need is to separate <i>shadows</i> from the <i>shading</i>.
<p>
This can be done using use <i>mip_matteshadow</i>. Lets show
the result by applying the shader with a white background and
black shadows:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/prod-shadowcatch-selfsh.jpg" alt="Raw shadow information"><br />Raw shadow information
</div>
<p>
This image contains the raw shadow information, and is otherwise
white. This mode of operation is very useful for external compositing
usage, where a completely separate <i>shadow pass</i> can be 
generated by making the synthetic objects invisible to the camera
(the torus in our case) and using <i>mip_shadowmatte</i> with
white background and black shadows.
<p>
<em>NOTE:</em> This usage supports colored shadows! 
With a red and green light present, the green light will show
red shadows and vice versa.
<p>
There is one problem with the above image: It contains a shadow
of the salt shaker. But our real-world picture already contains
a shadow of the salt shaker. This is solved by the following steps:
<br />
<ul>

<li> Applying <i>mip_matteshadow</i> as the 
      shadow shader for the material.
<li> Turning its <b>no_self_shadow</b> option on.
</ul>

<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/prod-shadowcatch-noself.jpg" alt="The mip_matteshadow material does not shadow itself"><br />The mip_matteshadow material does not shadow itself
</div>
<p>
When the shader is used as the materials shadow shader and 
the <b>no_self_shadow</b> is on, no object with 
<i>mip_matteshadow</i> will shadow another object with 
<i>mip_matteshadow</i>, but will still cast shadows on
other objects, and other objects will cast shadows upon it.
<p>
Notice however that the shadows are very dark and the torus 
shadow thrown <em>onto</em> the salt shaker has a harsh left
edge. To solve this, one can set the <b>ambient</b> color
to a low value and turn on <b>use_dot_nl</b> which will
make the shadows &quot;fade out&quot; as they become perpendicular
to the light, avoiding the harsh edge:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/prod-shadowcatch-lighter-shad-dotnl.jpg" alt="Lighter shadow and use_dot_nl on"><br />Lighter shadow and use_dot_nl on
</div>
<p>
At this point we can replace the white color with our background
using <i>mip_cameramap</i>:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/prod-shadowcatch-lighter-dotnl-bg.jpg" alt="Background used instead of white"><br />Background used instead of white
</div>
<p>
<h3 id="Advanced_Catching_of_Shadows">Advanced Catching of Shadows</h3>
<p>
Shadows can be handled in several ways with <i>mip_matteshadow</i>.
We already mentioned the method above of creating a shadow pass
using a white <b>background</b> and black <b>shadows</b> setting.
<p>
We also showed the method of using a picture for <b>background</b>
and black for <b>shadows</b>.
<p>
There are two other options, however:
<p>
One is to use a picture of the <em>lit</em> scene for <b>background</b>
and <em>another</em> picture of the scene in shadow for the <b>shadow</b>
parameter. 
<div class="pic">
<img width="80%" src="images/prod-bg-only.jpg" alt="The scene fully lit"><br />The scene fully lit<br /><img width="80%" src="images/prod-bg-shadowed.jpg" alt="The scene in shadow"><br />The scene in shadow<br /></div>
<p>
This technique is especially useful since it solves <em>any</em>
self-shadowing issues perfectly, it is even advised to have 
<b>no_self_shadow</b> off in this mode. Here is the result:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/prod-two-pic-shadow.jpg" alt="Shadows come from unlit version of photo"><br />Shadows come from unlit version of photo
</div>
<p>
This gives amazing detail and automatically gives the &quot;correct&quot;
color and strength of shadows without any tuning being necessary.
<p>
A final way is to handle shadows completely in external compositing.
This is accomplished by setting <b>background</b> to 0 0 0 0 
(i.e. transparent black, alpha is zero) and <b>shadow</b> to 0 0 0 1 
(i.e. opaque black, alpha is one).
<p>
This will create a rendering as follows:
<div class="pic">
<img width="80%" src="images/prod-matted-torus-shadows.jpg" alt="The color channels"><br />The color channels<br /><img width="80%" src="images/prod-matted-torus-shadows-alpha.jpg" alt="The alpha channel"><br />The alpha channel<br /></div>
<p>
This image can be composited on top of the background externally since
the shadow information is present in the alpha channel.
<p>
<h3 id="Reflections">Reflections</h3>
<p>
Since we are using <i>mip_cameramap</i> reflections and refractions
of the background objects work correctly:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/prod-reflecrac-demo.jpg" alt="Reflection and refraction"><br />Reflection and refraction
</div>
<p>
Note how even the reflection of the salt shaker is correct.
<p>
Note that this also means final gathering will pick up the background
as indirect illumination correctly:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/prod-reflecrac-fg-demo.jpg" alt="Final gathering lights up our objects"><br />Final gathering lights up our objects
</div>
<p>
The shader can also show (glossy) reflections of other objects:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/prod-reflecrac-fg-gloss-demo.jpg" alt="Glossy paper reflects our objects"><br />Glossy paper reflects our objects
</div>
<p>
Please note how the reflection only involves the actual synthetic
objects added, the shader already assumes that the real world
photo contains reflections for the other real world objects, i.e.
a <i>mip_matteshadow</i> object never reflects another, nor
does it reflect the environment.
<p>

One subtle detail is still missing, though. Notice how the 
cylinder is reflecting the paper, but nothing else. This is
because the <b>mip_matteshadow</b> does not know what to 
do about rays that hit the ground plane somewhere &quot;off
screen&quot;.
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/prod-cylinder-bad.jpg" alt="No reflections"><br />No reflections
</div>
<p>
This is solved by using the <b>offscreen_is_environment</b>
parameter of <b>mip_cameramap</b>, and then utilize 
an environment map (for example <b>mip_mirrorball</b>) to
supply an environment map:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/prod-cylinder-ok.jpg" alt="Much better"><br />Much better
</div>
<p>

The shader can also receive indirect light such as final
gathering and (if also applied as photon shader) photons. 
To demonstrate this we enable <b>catch_indirect</b> and turn 
our white objects luminous red and made sure our glass sphere 
generates caustics:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/prod-reflecrac-fg-caustic-demo.jpg" alt="Receiving indirect light"><br />Receiving indirect light
</div>
<p>
As above, the shader makes sure no indirect light is bounced
from one matte object to another, and no indirect light is received
from the environment (since both these effects are assumed to be
present in the original real-world photo).
<p>
 
A final special case for reflection is when the background photo
already contains massive amounts of reflections. Here is 
a new background photo on top of a highly reflective surface:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/prod-shiny-plate.jpg" alt="Photograph of our salt shaker on a very reflective surface"><br />Photograph of our salt shaker on a very reflective surface
</div>
<p>
If we add our synthetic objects to this scene and use the same settings
we used for the glossy paper, we get the following rather odd looking 
results:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/prod-subtr-ref-off.jpg" alt="Additive reflections - doesn't look right"><br />Additive reflections - doesn't look right

But this looks very incorrect! One can see the reflection of the 
background through the added reflections, and the added reflections 
appear much too bright.
<p>
To fix this one uses the <b>refl_subtract</b> to set the amount of
attenuation of the background caused by the reflection. Naturally this
can be a painted map to match reflective areas in the image, i.e. a
water puddle in front of a house etc.

<p>
The correct result. The synthetic reflections override the
existing reflections and replace them! Also note that even 
reflections of objects
<em>behind a real world object inside a real world reflection</em>
works correctly (the white ball 
behind the salt shaker is behind it even in the reflection).
<p>
Finally, all objects pick up indirect illumination based on the 
background plate itself. Only one rectangular area light source exists 
in the rendering.

<h3 id="Reflections_and_Alpha">Reflections and Alpha</h3>
<p>
When preparing for external compositing and using transparent black
for <b>background</b> and opaque black for <b>shadows</b> it is
important that reflections also get an alpha channel.
<p>
The alpha component of the <b>refl_color</b> parameter defines
how much the reflection is present in the alpha channel. 
<p>
Likewise the alpha component of the <b>indirect</b> parameter
defines how much indirect light is seen in the alpha channel.
<p>
Neither of those have any function if the alpha of the background
is 1.0, i.e. when using a background photo.

<p>
If one need the synthetic objects to reflect the real objects but
still want the flexibility of external compositing for shadows (i.e.
one does not want to add in the background already when rendering)
one can create a hybrid approach.
<p>
This is accomplished with the help of the <i>mip_rayswitch</i>
shader. Use the shader to switch between using a transparent
black (0 0 0 0) background for eye rays and using the camera mapped
photo for other rays (e.g. reflection, refraction and final gathering).

Here is a simple step-by-step workflow to render synthetic objects into a 
background plate. It assumes one has
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/prod-prereq.jpg" alt="Prerequisite stuff"><br />Prerequisite stuff
</div>
<br />
<ul>

<li> A background plate       
<li> A mirror ball photo taken from the same camera angle
      <a href="#Foot4" title="One can often get away with a low dynamic range mirror ball photo if one keeps it slightly underexposed."><sup>4</sup></a>
</ul>
           
<p>
Then perform as follows:
<br />
<ul>

<li> Put <b>mip_rayswitch_environment</b> in the mental ray camera 
      environment.
<li> In its <b>background</b> slot, use a <b>mip_cameramap</b>
      with the background plate in its <b>map</b> slot. 
<li> In its <b>environment</b> slot, use <b>mip_mirrorball</b> with 
      the mirror ball photo in its <b>map</b> slot.
<li> Create a ground plane, and use <b>mip_matteshadow</b> as the
      surface, shadow and photon shader on that ground plane. 
<li> Use the <em>same</em> instance of <b>mip_cameramap</b> in its 
      <b>background</b> parameter.
<li> Add lights to mimic the &quot;real world&quot; lighting, or use 
      final gathering based on the environment, or a combination thereof
      to achieve the proper shading.
<li> Tune any ambient occlusion by setting the <b>ambient</b> parameter
      of <b>mip_matteshadow</b> and adjusting the <b>ao_distance</b>.
<li> If the &quot;ground&quot; should catch general indirect lighting, enable
      <b>catch_indirect</b> and connect the map in <b>background</b> 
      to <b>indirect</b> as well.

   When we use the term &quot;synthetic&quot; we mean additional objects
   to be inserted in the scene, and &quot;real world&quot; for objects
   that are already there.

    The difference between <b>lights</b> and <b>illuminators</b> is that
    the <b>lights</b> are only used to cause shadows on the background,
    whereas the <b>illuminators</b> are used to throw actual <em>light</em>
    on it. This means that the <b>lights</b> array should contain lights
    which are already present in the background plate, and the 
    <b>illuminators</b> array contains any additional lights introduced
    by a CG element, for example the headlights of a CG car.

    For example to add a specular
    highlight to an illuminator by plugging in a <b>mib_illum_phong</b>
    with it's diffuse color set to black.

                photo if one keeps it slightly underexposed.
