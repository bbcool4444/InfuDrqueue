<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
Real world objects photographed with a real world camera exhibit
<i>motion blur</i>. When rendering in mental ray, one has several 
choices for how to achieve these trade-offs. There are three 
principally different methods:
<br />
<ul>

<li> Raytraced 3d motion blur
<li> Fast rasterizer (aka. &quot;rapid scanline&quot;) 3d motion blur
<li> Post processing 2d motion blur
</ul>

<p>
Each method has it's advantages and disadvantages:
<p>
<h3 id="Raytraced_3d_Motion_Blur">Raytraced 3d Motion Blur</h3>
<p>
This is the most advanced and &quot;full featured&quot; type of motion blur.
For every spatial sample within a pixel, a number of temporal rays
are sent. The number of rays are defined by the &quot;time contrast&quot; set
in the options block, the actual number being  1 / &quot;time contrast&quot;
(unless the special mode &quot;fast motion blur&quot; is enabled, which sends
a single temporal sample per spatial sample<a href="#Foot1" title="&quot;Fast motion blur&quot; mode is enabled by setting &quot;time contrast&quot; to zero and having the upper and lower image sampling rates the same, i.e. something like &quot;samples 2 2&quot;. Read more about &quot;Fast motion blur&quot; mode at http://www.lamrug.org/resources/motiontips.html "><sup>1</sup></a>).
<p>
Since every ray is shot at a different time, <i>everything</i> is 
motion blurred in a physically correct manner. A flat moving mirror
moving in it's mirror plane will only show blur on it's edges -
the mirror reflection itself will be stationary. Shadows, reflections,
volumetric effects... everything is correctly motion blurred. Motion
can be multi-segmented, meaning rotating object can have motion 
blur &quot;streaks&quot; that go in an arc rather than a line.
<p>
But the trade-off is rendering time, since full ray tracing is 
performed multiple times at temporal sampling locations, and
every ray traced evaluates the full shading model of the sample.
<p>
With this type of motion blur, the render time for a motion blurred
object increases roughly linearly with the number of temporal 
samples (i.e. 1 / &quot;time contrast&quot;).
<p>
<h3 id="Fast_Rasterizer_(aka_&quot;Rapid_Scanline&quot;)_Motion_Blur">Fast Rasterizer (aka &quot;Rapid Scanline&quot;) Motion Blur</h3>
<p>
The rasterizer is the new &quot;scanline&quot; renderer introduced in mental
ray 3.4, and it performs a very advanced subpixel tessellation which
decouples <i>shading</i> and <i>surface sampling</i>.
<p>
The rasterizer takes a set of shading samples and allows a low 
number of shading samples to be re-used as spatial samples. The 
practical advantage is that fast motion blur (as well as extremely
high quality anti aliasing, which is why one should generally use the
rasterizer when dealing with hair rendering) is possible.
<p>
The trade-off is that the shading samples are re-used. This means
that the flat mirror in our earlier example will actually smear
the reflection in the mirror together with the mirror itself. In
most practical cases, this difference is not really visually 
significant.
<p>
The motion blur is still fully 3d, and the major advantage is that
the rendering time does <i>not</i> increase linearly with the 
number of samples per pixel, i.e. using 64 samples per pixel is
<i>not</i> four times slower than 16 samples. The render time
is more driven by the number of shading samples per pixel.
<p>
<h3 id="Post_Processing_2d_Motion_Blur">Post Processing 2d Motion Blur</h3>
<p>
Finally we have motion blur as a post process. It works by using
pixel motion vectors stored by the rendering phase and &quot;smearing&quot;
these into a visual simulation of motion blur.
<p>
Like using the rasterizer, this means that features such as 
mirror images or even objects seen through foreground transparent
object will &quot;streak&quot; together with the foreground object.
Furthermore, since the motion frame buffer only stores one segment, 
the &quot;streaks&quot; are always straight, never curved.
<p>
The major advantage of this method is rendering speed. Scene or
shader complexity has no impact. The blur is applied as a mental
ray &quot;output shader&quot;, which is executed after the main rendering
pass is done. The execution time of the output shader depends on
how many pixels need to be blurred, and how far each pixel needs
to be &quot;smeared&quot;.
<p>
<h2 id="Considerations_when_Using_2d_Motion_Blur">Considerations when Using 2d Motion Blur</h2>
<p>
<h3 id="Rendering_Motion_Vectors">Rendering Motion Vectors</h3>
<p>
The scene must be rendered with the <i>motion vectors</i> 
frame buffer enabled and filled with proper motion vectors. 
This is accomplished by rendering with motion blur turned 
<i>on</i>, but with a shutter length of <i>zero</i>. 
<p>
<pre>
    shutter 0 0
    motion on
</pre>
<p>
Note the order: &quot;motion on&quot; must come after &quot;shutter 0 0&quot;. 
<p>
In older versions of mental ray the following construct was
necessary:
<p>
<pre>
    motion on
    shutter 0 0.00001
    time contrast 1 1 1 1
</pre>
<p>
Which means:
<br />
<ul>

<li> Setting a very very short but non-zero shutter length
<li> Using a time contrast of 1 1 1 1
</ul>

<p>
If there is a problem and no motion blur is visible, try the 
above alternate settings.
<p>
<h3 id="Visual_Differences___Opacity_and_Backgrounds">Visual Differences - Opacity and Backgrounds</h3>
<p>
The 3d blur is a true rendering of the object as it moves
along the time axis. The 2d blur is a <i>simulation</i> of this
effect by taking a still image and <i>streaking</i> it along the
2d on-screen motion vector.
<p>
It is important to understand that this yields slightly different
results, visually.
<p>
For example, an object that moves a distance equal to
<i>it's own width</i> during the shutter interval will
effectively occupy each 
point along it's trajectory 50 percent of the time. This means
the motion blurred &quot;streak&quot; of the object will effectively be rendered 
50 percent transparent, and any background behind it will show through
accordingly.
<p>
In contrast, an object rendered with the 2d motion blur will be
rendered in a stationary position, and then these pixels are later
smeared into the motion blur streaks. This means that over the
area the object originally occupied (before being smeared) it will
still be completely opaque with no background showing through, and 
the &quot;streaks&quot; will fade out in both directions from this location,
allowing the background to show through on each side.
<p>
The end result is that moving objects appear slightly more &quot;opaque&quot;
when using 2d blur vs true 3d blur. In most cases and for moderate
motion, this is not a problem and is never perceived as a problem. 
Only for extreme cases of motion blur will this cause any significant
issues.

<p>
<a name="timing"></a>
<h3 id="Shutters_and_Shutter_Offsets">Shutters and Shutter Offsets</h3>
<p>
To illustrate this behavior of the mental ray shutter interval
we use these images of a set of still cones and two moving 
checkered balls that move such that on frame 0 they are over 
the first cone, on frame 1 they are over the second cone, etc:
<div class="pic">
<img width="80%" src="images/t0.jpg" alt="Object at t=0"><br />Object at t=0<br /><img width="80%" src="images/t1.jpg" alt="Object at t=1"><br />Object at t=1<br /></div>
<p>
When using 3d motion blur, the mental ray virtual cameras 
shutter open at the time set by &quot;shutter offset&quot; and closes
at the time set by &quot;shutter&quot;. 
<p>
Here is the result with a shutter offset of 0 and a shutter of 0.5 - 
the objects blur &quot;begins&quot; at t=0 and continues over to t=0.5:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/3dblurB0-05.jpg" alt="3d blur, shutter open at t=0 and close at t=0.5"><br />3d blur, shutter open at t=0 and close at t=0.5
</div>
<p>
Now when using the <b>2d motion blur</b> it is important to 
understand how it works. The frame is rendered at the &quot;shutter
offset&quot; time, and then those pixels are streaked
<i>both forwards and backwards</i> to create the blur effect,
hence, with the same settings, this will be the resulting blur:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/2dblurB-0-05.jpg" alt="2d blur, shutter offset=0, mip_motionblur shutter=0.5"><br />2d blur, shutter offset=0, mip_motionblur shutter=0.5
</div>
<p>
Note this behavior is <i>different</i> than the 3d blur case! If
one need to mix renderings done with both methods, it is
<b>important to use such settings to make the timing of the blur identical</b>.
<p>
This is achieved by changing the &quot;shutter offset&quot; time to the 
desired <i>center time</i> of the blur (in our case t=0.25), like 
this:
<p>
<pre>
    shutter 0.25 0.25
    motion on
</pre>
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/2dblurB-025-05.jpg" alt="2d blur, shutter offset=0.25, mip_motionblur shutter=0.5"><br />2d blur, shutter offset=0.25, mip_motionblur shutter=0.5
</div>
<p>
Note how this matches the 3d blurs setting when shutter offset is 0. 
If, however, the 3d blur is given the shutter offset of 0.25 and shutter 
length 0.5 (i.e. a &quot;shutter 0.25 0.75&quot; statement), the result is this:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/3dblurB025-075.jpg" alt="3d blur, shutter open at t=0.25 and close at t=0.75"><br />3d blur, shutter open at t=0.25 and close at t=0.75
</div>
<p>
Hence it is clear that when compositing renders done with different
methods it is <i>very important</i> to keep this difference in timing
in mind!
<p>
<h2 id="The_mip_motionblur_Shader">The mip_motionblur Shader</h2>
<p>
The <i>mip_motionblur</i> shader is a mental ray <i>output shader</i> for
performing 2.5d<a href="#Foot2" title="Called &quot;2.5d&quot; since it also takes the Z-depth relationship between objects into account"><sup>2</sup></a> motion blur as a 
post process.
<p>
<pre>
    declare shader "mip_motionblur" (
            scalar  "shutter",
            scalar  "shutter_falloff",
            boolean "blur_environment",        
            scalar  "calculation_gamma",
            scalar  "pixel_threshold",
            scalar  "background_depth",
            boolean "depth_weighting",
            string  "blur_fb",
            string  "depth_fb",
            string  "motion_fb",
            boolean "use_coverage"
        )
        version 1
        apply output
    end declare
</pre>
<p>
<b>shutter</b> is the amount of time the shutter is &quot;open&quot;. In practice 
this means that after the image has been rendered the pixels are smeared 
into streaks in both the forward and backward direction, each a distance equal 
to half the distance the object moves during the shutter time.
<p>
<b>shutter_falloff</b> sets the drop-off speed of the smear, i.e. how
quickly it fades out to transparent. This tweaks the &quot;softness&quot; of the
blur:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/fo1.jpg" alt="falloff = 1.0"><br />falloff = 1.0
</div>
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/fo2.jpg" alt="falloff = 2.0"><br />falloff = 2.0
</div>
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/fo4.jpg" alt="falloff = 4.0"><br />falloff = 4.0
</div>
<p>
Notice how the highlight is streaked into an almost uniform line in 
the first image, but tapers off much more gently in the last image.
<p>
It is notable that the <i>perceived length</i> of the motion blur
diminishes with increased falloff, so one may need to compensate
for it by increasing the shutter slightly.
<p>
Therefore, falloff is especially useful when wanting the effect 
of over-bright highlights &quot;streaking&quot; convincingly: By using an inflated
shutter length (above the cinematic default of 0.5) and a higher falloff,
over-brights have the potential to smear in a pleasing fashion.
<p>
<b>blur_environment</b> defines if the camera environment (i.e.
the background) should be blurred by the cameras movement or not.
When <i>on</i>, pixels from the environment will be blurred, and
when <i>off</i> it will not. Please note that camera driven
environment blur <em>only</em> works if &quot;scanline&quot; is off in the 
options block.
<p>
If the background is created by <i>geometry</i> in the scene, this
setting does not apply, and the backgrounds blur will be that of
the motion of said geometry.
<p>
<b>calculation_gamma</b> defines in what gamma color space blur 
calculations take place. Since mental ray output shaders are performed 
on written frame buffers, and these buffers (unless floating point) 
already have any gamma correction applied, it is important that post
effects are applied with the appropriate gamma.
<p>
If you render in linear floating point and plan to do the proper gamma
correction at a later stage, set <b>calculation_gamma</b> to 1.0, 
otherwise set it to the appropriate value. The setting can also be
used to artistically control the &quot;look&quot; of the motion blur, in which
a higher gamma value favors lightness over darkness in the streaks.
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/mb-gamma.jpg" alt="Various gammas"><br />Various gammas
</div>
<p>

<p>
Notice how the low gamma examples seem much &quot;darker&quot;, and how the 
blur between the green box and red sphere looks questionable. The
higher gamma values cause a smoother blend and more realistic motion
blur. However, it cannot be stressed enough, that if gamma correction 
is applied <i>later in the pipeline</i> the calculation_gamma
parameter should be kept at 1.0, unless one really desires the favoring
of brightness in the blur as an artistic effect.
<p>
The <b>pixel_threshold</b> is a minimum motion vector length (measured 
in pixels) an object must move before blur is added.
If set to 0.0 it has no effect, and every object even with
sub-pixel movement will have a slight amount of blur. While this is
technically <i>accurate</i>, it may cause the image to be perceived as 
overly blurry.
<p>
For example, a cockpit view from a low flying jet plane rushing away 
towards a tropical island on the horizon may still add a some motion blur 
to the island on the horizon itself even though its movement is very 
slight. Likewise, blur is added even for an extremely slow pan across an 
object. This can cause things to be perceived slightly &quot;out of focus&quot;, 
which is undesirable.
This can be solved by setting <b>pixel_threshold</b> to e.g. 1.0, which 
in effect subtracts one pixel from the length of all motion vectors and
hence causing all objects moving only one pixel (or less) between 
frames not to have any motion blur at all. Naturally, this value should
be kept very low (in the order of a pixel or less) to be anywhere near 
realistic, but it can be set to higher value for artistic effects.
<p>
The <b>background_depth</b> sets a distance to the background, which
helps the algorithm figure out the depth layout of the scene. The value
should be about as large as the scene depth, i.e. anything beyond this
distance from the camera would be considered &quot;far away&quot; by the algorithm.
<p>
If <b>depth_weighting</b> is off, a heuristic algorithm is used to
depth sort the blur of objects. Sometimes the default algorithm can 
cause blur of distant objects imposing on blurs of nearby objects. 
Therefore an alternate algorithm is available by turning 
<b>depth_weighting</b> on. 
This causes objects closer to the camera than <b>background_depth</b> 
to get an increasingly &quot;opaque&quot; blur than further objects, the closer
objects blurs much more likely to &quot;over-paint&quot; further objects blurs.
Since this may cause near-camera objects blurs to be unrealistically 
opaque, the option defaults to being off. This mode is most useful when
there is clear separation between a moving foreground object against
a (comparatively) static background.
<p>
<b>blur_fb</b> sets the ID<a href="#Foot3" title="This parameter is of type string to support the named frame buffers introduced in mental ray 3.6. If named frame buffers are not used, the string will need to contain a number, i.e. &quot;3&quot; for frame buffer number 3. "><sup>3</sup></a> of the frame buffer to be blurred. 
An empty string (&quot;&quot;) signifies the main color frame buffer. 
The frame buffer referenced must be a RGBA color buffer and must be 
written by an appropriate shader.
<p>
<b>depth_fb</b> sets the ID of the frame buffer from which to obtain
depth information. An empty string (&quot;&quot;) signifies the main 
mental ray z depth frame buffer. The frame buffer referenced must be a depth
buffer and must be written by an appropriate shader.
<p>
<b>motion_fb</b> works identically to <b>depth_fb</b> but for the motion
vector information, and the empty string here means the default mental ray motion 
vector frame buffer. The frame buffer referenced must be a motion buffer and must 
be written by an appropriate shader.
<p>
<b>use_coverage</b>, when on, utilizes information in the &quot;coverage&quot; channel 
rather than the alpha channel when deciding how to utilize edge pixels that
contain an anti-aliased mix between two moving objects.
<p>
<a name="usingpostblur"></a>
<h2 id="Using_mip_motionblur">Using mip_motionblur</h2>
<p>
As mentioned before, the shader <i>mip_motionblur</i> requires the scene to be 
rendered with motion vectors:
<p>
<pre>
    shutter 0 0
    motion on
</pre>
<p>
The shader itself must also be added to the camera as an output shader:
<p>
<pre>
   shader "motion_blur" "mip_motionblur" (
      "shutter"          0.5,
      "shutter_falloff"  2.0,
      "blur_environment" on
   )
   camera "...."
      output "+rgba_fp,+z,+m" = "motion_blur"
      ...
   end camera
</pre>
<p>
The shader requires the depth (&quot;z&quot;) and motion (&quot;m&quot;) frame buffers and
they should either both be interpolated (&quot;+&quot;) or neither (&quot;-&quot;). 
The shader is optimized for using interpolated buffers but non-interpolated
work as well.
<p>
If one wants to utilize the feature that the shader properly preserves 
and streaks over-brights (colors whiter than white) the color frame buffer
must be floating point (&quot;rgba_fp&quot;), otherwise it can be plain &quot;rgba&quot;.
<p>
<h3 id="Multiple_Frame_Buffers_and_Motion_Blur">Multiple Frame Buffers and Motion Blur</h3>
<p>
If one is working with shaders that writes to multiple frame buffers
one can chain multiple copies of the <i>mip_motionblur</i> shader after 
one another, each referencing a different <b>blur_fb</b>, allowing one 
to blur several frame buffers in one rendering operation. Please note
that only <i>color</i> frame buffers can be blurred!
<p>
Also please note that for compositing operations it is <em>not</em> 
recommended to use a <b>calculation_gamma</b> other than 1.0
because otherwise the compositing math may not work correctly.
Instead, make sure to use proper gamma management in the compositing
phase.
<p>
<h3 id="Good_Defaults">Good Defaults</h3>
<p>
Here are some suggested defaults:
<p>
For a fairly standard looking blur use <b>shutter</b> of 0.5 and a
<b>shutter_falloff</b> of 2.0. 
<p>
For a more &quot;soft&quot; looking blur turn the shutter up to 
<b>shutter</b> 1.0 but also increase the <b>shutter_falloff</b> 
to 4.0. 
<p>
To match the blur of other mental ray renders, remember to set the
mental ray shutter offset (in the options block) to half of that of
the shutter length set in <i>mip_motionblur</i>. To match the
motion blur to match-moved footage (where the key frames tend to
lie in the center of the blur) use a shutter offset of 0.
<p>
<h2 id="The_mip_motion_vector_Shader">The mip_motion_vector Shader</h2>
<p>
Sometimes one wishes to do compositing work before applying motion blur,
or one wants to use some specific third-party motion blur shader. For
this reason the <i>mip_motion_vector</i> shader exists, the purpose of
which is to export motion in pixel space (mental ray's standard motion 
vector format is in world space) encoded as a color.
<p>
There are several different methods of encoding motion as a color and
this shader supports the most common. 
<p>
Most third party tools expect the motion vector encoded as colors 
where red is the X axis and green is the Y axis. 
To fit into the confines of a color (especially when
not using floating point and a color only reaches from black to white)
the motion is scaled by a factor (here called <b>max_displace</b>) and
the resulting -1 to 1 range is mapped to the color channels 0 to 1 
range.
<p>
The shader also support a couple of different floating point output
modes.
<p>
The shader looks as follows:
<p>
<pre>
    declare shader "mip_motion_vector" (
            scalar  "max_displace"    default 50.0,
            boolean "blue_is_magnitude",
            integer "floating_point_format",
            boolean "blur_environment",        
            scalar  "pixel_threshold",
            string  "result_fb",
            string  "depth_fb",
            string  "motion_fb",
            boolean "use_coverage"
        )
        version 2
        apply output
    end declare
</pre>
<p>
The parameter <b>max_displace</b> sets the maximum encoded motion
vector length, and motion vectors of this number of pixels (or above) 
will be encoded as the maximum value that is possible to express within 
the limit of the color (i.e. white or black).
<p>
To maximally utilize the resolution of the chosen image format, it
is generally advised to use a <b>max_displace</b> of 50 for 8 bit
images (which are not really recommended for this purpose) and a
value of 2000 for 16 bit images. The shader outputs an informational
statement of the maximum motion vector encountered in a frame to aid
in tuning this parameter. Consult the documentation for your
third party motion blur shader for more detail.
<p>
If the <b>max_displace</b> is zero, motion vectors are encoded
relative to the image resolution, i.e. for an image 600 pixels wide
and 400 pixels high, a movement of 600 pixels in positive X is encoded
as 1.0 in the red channel, a movement 600 pixels in negative X is encoded 
as 0.0. A movement in positive Y of 400 pixels is encoded as 1.0 in the
blue channel etc<a href="#Foot4" title="This mode will not work with 8 bit images since they do not have sufficient resolution."><sup>4</sup></a>.
<p>
<b>blue_is_magnitude</b>, when on, makes the blue color channel 
represent the magnitude of the blur, and the red and green only encodes
the 2d direction only. When it is off, the blue channel is unused and
the red and green channels encode both direction and magnitude. Again,
consult your third party motion blur shader 
documentation<a href="#Foot5" title="ReVisionFX &quot;Smoothkit&quot; expects vectors using blue_is_magnitude turned on, whereas their &quot;ReelSmart Motion Blur&quot; do not."><sup>5</sup></a>. 
<p>
If <b>floating_point_format</b> is nonzero the shader will write real, 
floating point motion vectors into the red and green channels. They are <b>not</b> 
normalized to the <b>max_displace</b> length, not clipped and will contain 
<em>both positive and negative values</em>. When this option is turned on
neither <b>max_displace</b> nor <b>blue_is_magnitude</b> has any effect.
<p>
Two different floating point output formats are currently supported:
<br />
<ul>

<li> 1: The actual pixel count is written as-is in floating point.
<li> 2: The pixel aspect ratio is taken into 
         account<a href="#Foot6" title="Compatible with Autodesk Toxik."><sup>6</sup></a> 
         such that the measurement of the distance the pixel moved 
         is expressed in pixels in the Y direction, the X component will 
         be scaled by the pixel aspect ratio. 
</ul>

<p>
More floating point formats may be added in the future.
<p>
When <b>blur_environment</b> is on, motion vectors are generated for the
empty background area controlled by the camera movement. This option does
not work if the scanline renderer is used.
<p>
The <b>pixel_threshold</b> is a minimum motion vector length (measured 
in pixels) an object must move before a nonzero vector is generated. 
In practice, this length is simply subtracted from the motion vectors 
before they are exported.
<p>
<b>result_fb</b> defines the frame buffer to which the result is written.
If it is unspecified (the empty string) the result is written to the standard
color buffer. However, it is more useful to define a separate frame buffer 
for the motion vectors and put its ID here. That way both the beauty render 
and the motion vector render are done in one pass. It should be a color buffer, 
and should not contain anything since it's contents will be overwritten by 
this shader anyway.
<p>
<b>depth_fb</b> sets the ID of the frame buffer from which to obtain
depth information. An empty string (&quot;&quot;) signifies the main 
mental ray z depth frame buffer. The frame buffer referenced must be a depth
buffer and must be written by an appropriate shader.

<b>motion_fb</b> works identically to <b>depth_fb</b> but for the motion
vector information, and the empty string here means the default mental ray motion 
vector frame buffer. The frame buffer referenced must be a motion buffer and must 
be written by an appropriate shader.
<p>
<h2 id="Using_mip_motion_vector">Using mip_motion_vector</h2>
<p>
The same considerations as when using <i>mip_motionblur</i> (page <a href="prod_motionblur.html#usingpostblur">usingpostblur</a>)
about generating motion vectors, as well as the discussion on page <a href="prod_motionblur.html#timing">timing</a>
above about the timing difference between post processing motion blur vs. 
full 3d blur both apply.
<p>
Furthermore, one generally wants to create a separate frame buffer for the
motion vectors, and save them to a file. Here is a piece of pseudo .mi syntax:
<p>
<pre>
   options ...
      ...
      # export motion vectors
      shutter 0 0
      motion on
      ...
      # Create a 16 bit frame buffer for the motion vectors
      frame buffer 0 "rgba_16" 
   end options
   ...
   shader "motion_export" "mip_motion_vectors" (
      "max_displace"     2000,
      "blur_environment" on,
      # our frame buffer
      "result_fb"        "0"    
   )
   ...
   camera "...."
      # The shader needs z, m
      output "+z,+m" = "motion_export"
      # Write buffers
      output "+rgba" "tif" "color_buffer.tif" 
      output "fb0"   "tif" "motion_buffer.tif"
      ...
   end camera
</pre>

&quot;Fast motion blur&quot; mode is enabled by setting &quot;time contrast&quot; to
zero and having the upper and lower image sampling rates the same, 
i.e. something like &quot;samples 2 2&quot;. Read more about &quot;Fast motion
blur&quot; mode at http://www.lamrug.org/resources/motiontips.html

<a name="Foot2"></a><dt>2
<dd>Called &quot;2.5d&quot; since it also takes
the Z-depth relationship between objects into account

<dd>
    This parameter is of type <em>string</em> to support the named frame buffers
    introduced in mental ray 3.6. If named frame buffers are not used, the 
    string will need to contain a number, i.e. &quot;3&quot; for frame buffer 
    number 3.

<dd>This mode will not work with 8 bit images
since they do not have sufficient resolution.
<a name="Foot5"></a><dt>5
<dd>ReVisionFX &quot;Smoothkit&quot; expects vectors using 
<b>blue_is_magnitude</b> turned on, whereas their 
&quot;ReelSmart Motion Blur&quot; do not.
