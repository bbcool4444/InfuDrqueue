  <h3 id="misss:manuallightmap">Passing Lightmaps Manually</h3>

  <p>
  The lightmaps are rendered in camera space, using adjacent pixels
  to store front- and back-surface light data. Since these are
  adjacent horizontally, this means that lightmaps should have a
  width greater than their height. If 500x500 actual samples of
  both the front and back surface are desired, the lightmap should
  be 1000x500 pixels.

  <p>The lightmap must be a 32-bit
  texture. Floating point RGBA is strictly required because Z depth
  information is stored in the alpha component. As a memory saving
  option, the .exr format may be used, with a negligible
  performance penalty and 50% memory savings.

  <p>The <var>depthmap</var> is not user assignable and is only used for the
  automatic mode. Its sole purpose is a small memory/performance optimization.
  </p>

  <h3 id="misss:autolightmap">Automatic Lightmap Generation</h3>

  <p> For ease of use, passing an explicit lightmap in the proper format is
  not required. However, since all participating shaders must know about the
  lightmaps used, a special kind of Phenomenon can be used in which the first
  two parameters of the Phenomenon must be the lightmap and depthmap pair.
  Anywhere the individual shaders are used within the Phenomenon, they must
  be linked to these first two parameters via <tt>interface</tt> connections,
  instead of being set to a specific value.</p>

  <p>Only if these conditions are met, automatic lightmap creation can be used.
  If the conditions are not met, manual specification of the lightmap have to
  be used.</p>

  <p>Here is pseudocode for a Phenomenon that meets these criteria:</p>
  <pre>
    declare phenomenon 
        material "my_sss_phenomenon" (
            color texture     "lightmap",                  # must be first
            color texture     "depthmap",                  # must be second
            color             "diffuse_paint",
            color             "my_special_color",
            scalar            "lightmap_size",             # for example
            ...
        )
        shader "myscattering" "misss_fast_shader" (
            "lightmap"        = interface "lightmap",      # required
            "depthmap"        = interface "depthmap",      # required
            "diffuse_illum"   ...
            ...
        )
        shader "mylightmapping"   "misss_lightmap_write" (
            "lightmap"        = interface "lightmap",      # required
            "depthmap"        = interface "depthmap",      # required
            "lightmap_group"  "A",
            "lightmap_size"   = interface "lightmap_size", # for example
            ...
        )
        ...
    end declare
</pre>

  <p>Failing to follow these guidelines may cause the Phenomenon to
  behave unpredictably and may possibly abort rendering when the
  shaders attempt to communicate over a parameter slot that is
  missing or used for another purpose.</p>

  <h3 id="misss:network">Network Rendering</h3>

  <p> When mental ray renders lightmaps, it tries to distribute the workload to
  several hosts on a per-object basis. However, the
  <i>misss_fast_</i> shaders encourage (due to memory efficiency)
  and in some cases require (for separate objects to scatter into
  each other) several objects to share the same lightmap.</p>

  <p>Multiple hosts writing into the same lightmap is not possible
  in mental ray, and will create a collision, where incomplete or incorrect
  lightmap data can be created.</p>

  <p>The following are some ways around the problem:</p>

  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li>Make sure every object has its own lightmap (scatter group).
    This will increase memory requirements.

    <li>Redesign the model to use fewer objects so there is one
    object per lightmap.

    <li>Render in passes by using the component shaders (instead of
    the supplied Phenomena) to render the lightmaps to file on a
    single host. In a second pass referencing these pre-created
    lightmaps render the final image on an arbitrary number of
    hosts.

    <li>Render on a single host.
  </ul>

  <p>Note, when using displacement, objects might be split automatically
  into many sub-objects that are tessellated and lightmapped individually.
  This causes one object to become many, making the first two workarounds
  listed impossible.
