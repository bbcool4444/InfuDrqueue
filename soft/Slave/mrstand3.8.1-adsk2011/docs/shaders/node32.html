  <h2>Phenomena</h2>

  <p>The supplied Phenomena are documented first since they are
  sufficient for most practical usage. Expert users can create
  their own Phenomena using these as templates or use the component
  shaders as described in <a href="node34.html#misss:advanced">
  Advanced Topics</a>. These Phenomena
  use structures to group the input parameters in logical groups,
  which are automatically grouped by the user interface of
  different OEM integrations of mental ray.</p>

  <h3>Fast Simple Phenomenon</h3>

  <p> This Phenomenon automatically (unless explicitly specified) generates
  the required lightmaps, fills in the lightmap data, and shades
  the objects as a general, translucent object with subsurface
  scattering. The scattering is divided into two parts, one for the
  front side of the object and one for the back.</p>

  <p>In a sense, the shader works by layering several light
  contributions on top of each other (see
  <a href="node33.html#mi_shader__misss_fast_shader">misss_fast_shader</a>)
  to get a final result. What is important to keep in mind are these rules of
  thumb:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The bump map only affects the <i>specular</i> and
    <i>diffuse_color</i> layers. The subsurface scattering happens
    below the surface and is oblivious to the surface having
    bumps.</li>

    <li>The <i>overall_color</i> affects all of the diffuse
    contributions, but not the specularity:</li>
  </ul>

<dl>
  <dt>lightmap<br>depthmap<dd> are normally not
  specified. These are special parameters the shaders use to
  communicate the name of the automatically created lightmaps
  between themselves. Expert users can pass writable textures and
  leave the <i>lightmap_group</i> and <i>lightmap_size</i>
  parameters undefined. See
  <a href="node34.html#misss:autolightmap">Automatic lightmap generation</a>.

  <dt>lightmap_group<dd> is the scatter group name. A
  lightmap/depthmap pair will be created internally and given this
  name. All objects that should scatter light into each other
  should be in the same scatter group. To conserve memory, use as
  few scatter groups as possible. A person's hands, face, etc. can
  use the same scatter group; even hands and faces of different
  people. In general, different scatter groups should be used only
  when using the same group would cause visible problems due to
  objects incorrectly scattering into each other. Two characters
  shaking hands, for instance, would need to have their hands in
  different scatter groups. (Also see the technical note on
  <a href="node34.html#misss:network">Network Rendering</a>.

  <dt>lightmap_size<dd> is size of the lightmap expressed in
  percent of render size. The lightmap is created in render space,
  and is related to final rendered screen pixels. 50% or less is
  often quite enough (and is the default), but if edge artifacts
  appear, increase this value.

  <dt>samples<dd> sets how many samples from the lightmap are
  considered (maximum) per rendered ray, ideally, a power of two.
  32 is probably the lowest useful value, 128 is plenty. However,
  if the scattering radii are large the sample count may need to be
  increased to avoid image noise.

  <dt>bump<dd> allows passing any shader that perturbs the normal
  for bumps. The shader's color output (if any) will not be
  used.

  <dt>ambient<dd> is the ambient component or any additional
  diffuse light added by any shader. This light will also be
  included in the lightmap and get scattered like any other light
  source and is hence the perfect place to add any HDRI light. The
  HDRI light can be based on environment and occlusion maps.

  <dt>overall_color<dd> is the <b>overall</b> diffuse color. All
  diffuse colors that follow below are multiplied with this global
  color to yield the final result. This parameter is useful for
  tinting the final computed diffuse color in a desired way or to
  apply maps that attenuate all diffuse light. Moles in skin, for
  example, block almost all underlying light (even scattered) and
  would make sense applied here, as would dirt, textured-on
  eyebrows, and such.

  <dt>diffuse_color<br>diffuse_weight<dd>color and weight
  (a simple multiplier for easier tweaking) of the normal Lambertian diffuse
  lighting, which is layered on top of any underlying scattered diffuse light.

  <dt>front_sss_color<br>front_sss_weight<dd> are the
  color and weight for the front surface scattering.

  <dt>front_sss_radius<dd> is the scatter radius in the front
  surface. Light will scatter this distance along the surface, in
  whatever units the model is made, divided by the
  <i>scale_conversion</i> parameter along the surface.

  <dt>back_sss_color<br>back_sss_weight<dd> are the color
  and weight for the back surface scattering, i.e. light going
  through the object.

  <dt>back_sss_radius<br>back_sss_depth<dd> are the
  scatter radius and depth for which light from the back surface is
  visible in the front surface. Normally, the radius and depth are
  set to the same value (and if the depth is not specified, it
  defaults to the radius) but can be set separately for increased
  control.

  <dt>specular<br>exponent<dd> specular color and Phong exponent
  for the specular highlight.

  <dt>lightmap_gamma<dd> is the gamma curve of the light stored
  in the lightmap. If this is 1.0, normal Lambertian diffuse light
  is stored. If it is less than 1.0, the curve is 'flattened'
  causing the light to spread out towards areas perpendicular to
  the incoming light. If it is higher than 1.0, the curve is
  'narrowed' causing the light to concentrate in areas directly
  facing the light source. In most cases, a value between 0.4 and
  0.8 is sufficient.

  <dt>indirect<dd>if true, includes any indirect lighting
  (photons, final gathering, etc) in the lightmap to be scattered.
  This takes additional render time and one should judge on a
  case-by-case basis if the indirect light is significant enough
  that seeing it scattered or not makes a big difference to justify
  the extra rendering time.

  <dt>scale_conversion<dd> is a simple utility function allowing
  linear division of all distances. Since scattering is distance
  dependent, loading a material designed for a model made in inches
  will not work on a model where the unit is meters, and vice
  versa. Here one can pass the conversion factor.

  <dt>scatter_bias<dd> if set to 0.0 the scattering is completely
  uniform. Positive values favor forward scattering, and negative
  values favor back scattering. The allowed range is -1.0 to 1.0,
  but the useful range is much smaller. A value of 0.1 (a slight
  favoring of forward scattering) is a good start.

  <dt>falloff<dd> sets the shape of the distance falloff along
  the scatter radius. Higher values yield a sharper falloff, and
  lower values a smoother falloff, but also make the perceived
  scatter distance shorter, so one must compensate by increasing
  the actual scatter distance for a slightly 'softer' look. For
  high values (1.0 to 10.0), almost all samples within the scatter
  radius are weighted equally. For low values (0.1 to 1.0), the
  samples near the edge of the scatter radius are weighted
  less.

  <dt>screen_composit<dd> when turned on, chooses Screen
  compositing. When simply adding together the contribution of many
  layers of light, it is very easy to quickly blow out and
  over-expose into white, but the human eye is inherently nonlinear
  and perceives intensities in a different way. This option allows
  use of what is known in many compositing applications as a screen
  transfer mode between the layers, which yields a softer, more
  pleasing result. If it is turned off, normal addition is used. If
  rendering in a high dynamic range and a proper tone-operator is
  applied in the final output stage already compressing the final
  luminance this should be turned off.

  <dt>mode<dd> is the mode selector for the
  <a href="node8.html#lightlists">light lists</a>.

  <dt>lights<dd> is the direct light list.

  <h3>Fast Skin Phenomenon</h3>

  <p> A more advanced Phenomenon for skin
  shading includes three-layer scattering and skin-specific
  specularity functionality. It shares many parameters with
  <i><a href="node32.html#INDEX94">misss_fast_simple_phen</a></i>.

<div class="pic">
<img src="images/subsurf_skingraph.jpg" />
<br />The structure of the skin shader</div>

  <p>Skin is simulated in layers as follows: A top reflective sheen
  layer (for specularity and surface non-scattered Lambertian
  diffuse reflections), a dual-layer subsurface scattering
  (simulating both the scattering in the epidermis and the layers
  below, here collectively named "subdermal"), and "through"
  scattering from the backside.</p>

  their counterparts in
  <i><a href="node32.html#INDEX94">misss_fast_simple_phen</a></i>.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>overall_color<dd> is the overall coloration of all diffuse
  components. This color will affect all the underlying layers
  (unscattered, epidermal, subdermal, back) and is good for overall
  color tweaks, or texture mapping surface features that should
  block out underlying light, such as skin moles, textured
  eyebrows, dirt, etc.

  <dt>diffuse_color<br>diffuse_weight<dd>color and weight of the
  normal Lambertian diffuse component. This
  represents the very top layer of the skin where all the tiny
  bumps are located. For caucasian skin the color would be mostly
  white with perhaps a small amount of blue and an appropriate
  diffuse weight would be around 0.3.

  <dt>front_sss_color<br>front_sss_weight<br>front_sss_radius<dd>
  are the color, weight and scatter radius
  within the Epidermal skin layer, which is the whiteish/yellowish
  layer just under the surface. Good values are a slightly
  yellowish color, a weight of 0.5, and a radius of around 5 to
  10mm (0.2 to 0.4 inches).

  <dt>mid_sss_color<br>mid_sss_weight<br>mid_sss_radius<dd>
  are the color, weight and scatter radius of
  the underlying subdermal skin layer. The functionality of the
  parameters is the same as those beginning with <i>front_</i> but
  is for yet another layer below the top layers, representing the
  deeper, reddish "meaty" scattering. A reddish/orangeish color
  with a weight of around 0.5 and a radius of 10 to 25mm (0.4 to
  1.0 inches) is a good starting point for experimentation.

  <dt>back_sss_color<br>back_sss_weight<br>back_sss_radius<br>
  <br>back_sss_depth<dd> represent light
  going straight through the flesh (for example for the "red
  ears" look).

  <dt>overall_weight<dd> is the overall level of specularity and
  reflections. Generally, any specularity map is included here and
  will affect the level of all specularity options that follow
  below.

  <dt>edge_factor<dd> sets the "edge width" of the edge
  reflection effects. Skin reflects more when watched in angles
  nearly perpendicular to it (known as a "Fresnel effect") and
  this parameter sets the narrowness of this edge. Higher values
  yield a thinner edge. This edge width applies to all the edge
  weights listed below.

  <dt>primary_spec_color<br>primary_spec_weight<dd> are
  the color and base weight for the first layer of specularity. The
  skin specularity functions are two-layered, allowing simulation
  of both the broad soft specularity of skin and any
  near-reflective specularities of top layer oiliness and
  wetness.

  <dt>primary_edge_weight<dd> sets the additional multiplier for
  the edge, where final specularity at the edge is the sum of
  <var>weight</var> and <var>edge weight</var>.

  <dt>primary_shinyness<dd> is the specular exponent (higher
  values yield a smaller and sharper specular highlight, which is a
  modified Phong model with edge softening).

  <dt>secondary_spec_color<br>secondary_spec_weight<br>
  <br>secondary_edge_weight<br>secondary_shinyness<dd> work
  exactly like the parameters that begin with <i>primary_</i> and
  are for the second layer of specularity. For skin, a good rule of
  thumb is to have a 1st specular layer with a very low shinyness
  (3.0 to 8.0) and a low level (0.1 to 0.3) but a rather high edge
  weight (0.5 to 1.0) and a slightly blueish color, and a 2nd layer
  that has high shinyness (20 to 100) and a medium level (0.3 to
  0.6) and no edge enhancement. Introducing mapping into the
  specularity channels enhances realism greatly.

  <dt>reflect_weight<br>reflect_edge_weight<dd> weight and edge weight
  for reflections. If it is nonzero, actual (glossy) reflections are added.

  <dt>reflect_shinyness<dd> is the shinyness value for glossy
  reflections. When it is 0.0, standard raytraced mirror
  reflections are used, but for nonzero values glossy reflections
  are generated, which increases render time.

  <dt>reflect_environment_only<dd> if true then only the current
  environment map is sampled for reflections, and no actual rays
  are traced.

  <dt>environment<dd> specifies a local environment shader.

  <dt>mode<dd> is the mode selector for the
