  <h2>Ray Tracing</h2>

  <h3>Reflection</h3>

  <p>Cast a reflection ray of a given color and merge the result
  with an input color. This can be used to add a reflection effect
  to a base shader that provides illumination, possibly in
  conjunction with refractions or transparency added by other base
  shaders. If no reflection ray can be cast (because the trace
  depth has been exceeded, or the reflection ray caused a shader to
  be called that failed, or the <var>notrace</var> parameter is set),
  sample the environment if there is one.</p>

  <dt>input<dd> is the color to composite the reflection

  <dt>reflect<dd> is an RGBA color that blends the reflection

  casting a reflected ray; opaque white returns the reflection
  color without evaluating the input color.

  <dt>notrace<dd>if set to true, prevents the shader from
  casting a reflection ray and samples the environment instead.
</dl>

  <h3>Refraction</h3>

  <p>Cast a refraction ray of a given color with an index of
  refraction, and merge the result with an input color. The indices
  of refraction can be computed with another base shader, such as
  <i>mib_refraction_index</i>, which is also stored back into the
  appropriate state variables. This can be used to add a refraction
  effect to a base shader that provides illumination.</p>

  <dt>ior<dd> is the ratio of the indices of refractions; the
  index of the object being entered divided by the index of the
  object being exited. This controls the outgoing ray direction. If
  it is 0, 1 is used, which reduces refractivity to transparency.
</dl>

  <h3>Transparency</h3>

  <p>Cast a transparency ray of a given color and merge the result
  with an input color. This is like the previous function assuming
  an index of refraction of 1.</p>

  <dt>transp<dd> is an RGBA color that blends the transmission

  color without evaluating the input color.
</dl>

  <h3>Continue</h3>

  <p>Continue a ray of a given color and merge the result with an
  input color. The purpose is to continue a ray as if the current
  intersection did not exist. Trace depth, ray type and distance
  for volume computations are not modified. A typical use is for
  walls of a showroom where the camera sits outside, so that the
  room walls must be ignored.</p>

  <h3>Opacity</h3>

  <p>Cast a transparency ray of a given intensity and merge the
  result with an input color. This is like the previous function,
  except that the opacity is given instead of the transparency.
  Opacity is defined as <i>1.0 - transparency</i>.</p>

  <dt>opacity<dd> is an RGBA color that blends the transmission
  onto the input. Opaque white returns the input color without
  casting a transparency ray; transparent black returns the
  transparency color without evaluating the input color.
</dl>

  <h3>Dielectric</h3>

  <p>Another variation of refraction, with the addition of
  specularity (Snell's law). This shader does only the refraction
  part of a dielectric material; highlights are left to other
  illumination nodes.</p>

  <a id="INDEX24"></a>
<h5 class="anchor" id="mi_shader__mib_dielectric">mib_dielectric</h5>
  <pre>
    color "mib_dielectric" (
        color           "input",
        color           "absorb",
        scalar          "refract",
        scalar          "ior")
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>input<dd> is the color to composite the refraction onto.

  <dt>absorb<dd> specifies the outside absorption coefficients of
  the surface.

  <dt>refract<dd> blends the refraction onto the input. A value
  of 0.0 returns the input color without casting a refracted ray; a
  value of 1.0 returns the refraction color without evaluating the
  input color.

  <dt>ior<dd> is the ratio of the indices of refractions; the
  index of the object being entered divided by the index of the
  object being exited. This controls the outgoing ray direction. If
  it is 0.0, 1.0 is used, which reduces refractivity to
  transparency.
</dl>

  <h3>Volume Fog</h3>

This is a simple fog shader. The shader operates on the result color provided
by a previously running shader, typically from a material shader at the far end
of the ray, and fades it toward a fog color based on ray length. Fading occurs
within a maximum distance, otherwise the fog color is considered solid. The
fog color is allowed to have an alpha value which limits the maximum opacity
of the fog. Attaching the fog color to a texture shader, for example, allows
transparent volume effects such as smoke or fire (set max to 0 to avoid fading).

<h5 class="anchor" id="mi_shader__mib_volume">mib_volume</h5>
<pre>
    color "mib_volume" (
        color           "color",
        scalar          "max",
        boolean         "lightrays")
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>color<dd>the fog color. The resulting color of the shader is faded
  towards this color based on the travelled ray length.

  <dt>max<dd>is the maximum internal space distance where fading should occur.
  Beyond this distance the fog is considered solid.

  <dt>lightrays<dd>if true the shader also applies to light rays, otherwise
  it does no operation on light rays. This option should be enabled for correct
  results but is expensive if the number of light rays is very large.

</dl>

  <h3>Ray Marcher</h3>

  <p>The ray marcher casts light rays from points on a given ray,
  and approximates the volumetric contribution from light sources
  sending light through the volume. Instead of using shader
  interface functions like <i>mi_sample_light</i>, it calls a
  shader given as an input parameter of type <i>shader</i>. Ray
  marching consists of calling the shader for regular points
  between the start point and end point of the ray, and adaptively
  subdividing each of these intervals until a given subdivision
  limit is reached if the color returned by two adjacent shader
  calls is smaller than a given contrast threshold. The total
  weighted sum is returned.</p>

  <a id="INDEX25"></a>
<h5 class="anchor" id="mi_shader__mib_ray_marcher">mib_ray_marcher</h5>
  <pre>
    color "mib_ray_marcher" (
        shader          "shader",
        scalar          "distance",
        integer         "num",
        integer         "subdiv",
        color           "contrast")
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>shader<dd> is the shader to call at every sampling point.
  Its returned color is added to the returned total unless the
  shader fails (returns false).

  <dt>distance<dd> is the maximum internal space distance between
  two initial sample points. If the distance is 0, no maximum
  distance is enforced.

  <dt>num<dd> is the initial number of samples in the given
  distance. If this number is 0, no initial number is given, and
  the ray marcher relies on the minimum distance instead. If both
  are 0, the default number is 4. If the number is not 0, it must
  be at least 2 (one at each ray end point).

  <dt>subdiv<dd> specifies the number of recursive subdivisions
  of the initial sample density. A value of 0 (the default) does
  not subdivide, so the ray marcher is restricted to the initial
  sample points. Values of 1 or larger make the sampling adaptive;
  each level of subdivision divides a distance by two. The maximum
  is 16.

  <dt>contrast<dd>if exceeded by the absolute difference
  between two adjacent samples, causes another sample to be taken
  in the middle. The process then repeats recursively for both
  sub-segments until the contrast is sufficiently low or the
  subdivision limit is reached.
</dl>

  <h3>Two-Sided</h3>

  <p>Choose one or the other input color, depending on which side
  of the geometry was hit. This is commonly used as a multiplexing
  material shader, with two other material shaders assigned to the
  front and back parameters.</p>

  <a id="INDEX26"></a>
<h5 class="anchor" id="mi_shader__mib_twosided">mib_twosided</h5>

</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>front<dd> is returned if the front side was hit.
  <dt>back<dd> is returned if the back side was hit.
</dl>

  <h3>Refraction Index</h3>

  <p>Decide whether the ray is entering or leaving the object it
  has hit, based on a scan of parent rays (not based on the normal
  vector; this can be unreliable if the scene contains dubious
  geometry such as cones with only one axis-aligned normal at the
  tip). The index of refraction ratio (outgoing divided by
  incoming) is returned. As a side effect, both incoming and
  outgoing indices of refraction are stored in the state
  (<i>ior_in</i> and <i>ior</i>, respectively), and the current
  volume shader becomes the refraction volume if the ray is
  entering.</p>

        boolean         "enter"
    } "mib_refraction_index" (
        scalar          "mtl_ior")
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>ior<dd> is the returned refraction index ratio, ready for
  use by refracting or dielectric base shaders.

  <dt>enter<dd> is true if the ray is entering the object. Most
  shaders do not need to know this but it makes this base shader
  more versatile.

  <dt>mtl_ior<dd> is the index of refraction of the material that
  the ray has hit. It describes the optical properties of the
  object the ray is entering or leaving, and is returned as the new
  index of refraction if the ray is found to be entering the
  object.
</dl>

<h3>Glossiness</h3>

  <p>
  The shaders described in this section are a way to generate glossy (blurred) 
  reflections and refractions. The following points illustrate the 
  performance and usability differences between these shaders and 
  the physics DGS shaders:</p>

  <ul>
  <li> Multi-sampled glossiness (vs. single samples)
  <li> Distance-bounded reflections/refractions
  <li> Undersampling of environment
  <li> Anisotropy without need for explicit UV vectors 
        (vs. derivative vectors required)
  <li> Normal-vector perturbing (vs. direction-vector-perturbing).
  <li> Fresnel effect
  <li> Chromatic abberations
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Multi-sampled glossiness</h4>
  
  <p>The DGS shaders shoot a single glossy ray for reflection and refraction, relying
  on the oversampling of the entire image (with the associated performance penalty) 
  to average out the samples for an attractive blur. 
  Every ray is a new independent sample.</p>

  <p>In contrast, the <em>mib_glossy_*</em> shaders take multiple glossy ray samples, 
  causing oversampling only on the glossy surfaces rather than the 
  whole image. Samples are created using mental ray's strictly deterministic sampling 
  engine and is hence able to create a more attractive sample pattern yielding a 
  "better looking" blur with the same number of samples.</p>
  
  <div class="pic">
  <img src="images/glossy_dgs-vs-mibblur0.jpg" />
  <br />DGS (left) vs. mib_glossy_reflection (right)
  </div>
  
  <p>
  The image above is rendered with <tt>samples 0 1</tt> and one can clearly see the
  grainy result on the left. To get a smooth result one would need to increase the
  sampling of the <em>entire image</em>. In contrast, <em>mib_glossy_*</em> handles
  it's own oversampling (in the example, 8 samples) and applies it only on the glossy
  surfaces themselves.</p>
  
  <h4>Distance bounded reflections/refractions</h4>
  
  <p>While strictly non-physical in the case of reflections, the <em>mib_glossy_*</em> 
  shaders allow one to limit the reach of both reflected and refracted rays. This helps
  eliminate image noise caused by distant reflected/refracted objects, and 
  can <em>vastly</em> improve performance.</p>
  
  <div class="pic">
  <img src="images/glossy_ref-bound-unbound.jpg" />
  <br>Unlimited reflections (left) vs. distance limited (right)
  </div>

  <h4>Undersampling of environment</h4>
  
  <p>One of the goals of the <em>mib_glossy_*</em> shaders is to avoid distant image 
  noise by filtering out distant objects and replacing with a material (in the case
  of refraction) or the environment (in the case of reflection). But to avoid
  excessive noise from sampling said environment, the reflection shader can
  intentionally single-sample the environment (and can even be passed an explicit
  pre-blurred environment) to remove noise.</p>
  
  <h4>Anisotropy without need for explicit UV vectors</h4>
  
  <p>The shaders can use explicitly-passed UV vectors for anisotropic glossy
  reflections/refractions, but will attempt to calculate sensible vectors
  themselves if these are missing (set to 0,0,0).</p>
  
  <h4>Normal vector perturbing</h4>

  <p>The DGS shaders calculate a specular reflected or refracted direction,
  and then perturb this direction within the range determined by the
  <var>shiny</var> parameter. In contrast, the <var>mib_glossy_*</var>
  shaders simulate glossiness as if the microfaceting is in the surface
  before the reflection or refraction.. This means the reflected and refracted
  directions are calculated by actually perturbing the normal vector (simulating
  a rough surface on a microscopic level), and calculating the new reflected
  or refracted direction based on the changed normal.</p>
  <p>
  It is notable that this yields <em>different results</em> and makes the glossiness
  <em>view direction dependent</em>. As an example, the glossiness pattern of reflections
  in a floor will be stretched vertically. This is the same effect one can see
  at a sunset over water, when the reflection of the sun seems stretched vertically
  into a long streak of sunlight.</p>

  <div class="pic">
  <img src="images/glossy_dgs-vs-mibblur.jpg" />
  <br />DGS shader (left) vs. mib_glossy_reflection (right)
  </div>

  <h4>Fresnel effect</h4>
  
  <p>Most reflective materials reflect more at glancing angles, and transparent 
  materials transmit more at facing angles. This re-balancing between
  reflectance and transmittance is known as a "fresnel effect". These shaders
  allow different weights to be set for "edges" (glancing angles) and "base"
  (facing angles) to emulate this effect. In the <var>mib_glossy_*</var>
  shaders, this effect is calculated  <em>per sample</em> instead of as a
  global weighting of the entire reflection for greater realism.</p>

  <div class="pic">
  <img src="images/glossy_fresnel-example.jpg" />
  <br />No fresnel effect (left) vs. Exaggerated fresnel effect (right)
  </div>

  <p>Notice how the edges (surfaces at a glancing angle) in the right image 
  reflect more than in the left image.</p>
  
  <h4>Chromatic aberration</h4>

  <p>The <var>mib_glossy_*</var> shaders have a <var>dispersion</var>
  parameter, which sets the amount of "faux chromatic aberration". The
  effect is <em>not</em> physically correct and only an emulation of
  the real phenomena.</p>

<h3>Glossy Reflection</h3>

<p>This is the shader for glossy <em>reflection</em>. It adds glossy reflection
to a base material connected to the shader.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>base_material<dd> is the base surface onto which the reflections
  are added. One can, for example, apply
  <i><a href="node8.html#mi_shader__mib_illum_phong">mib_illum_phong</a></i>,
  or any other surface shader, here.

  <dt>reflection_color<dd> defines the reflection strength (and coloration).
  The calculated reflections are simply multiplied by this value.

  <dt>max_distance<dd> if set to zero, the reach of the reflection rays are
  infinite. For values greater than zero, the reach of the reflection rays 
  are limited to this distance (with a huge performance gain), and the color 
  of the reflection is faded toward the environment color as the length 
  of the ray approaches this distance. 
  Use this parameter to improve performance and to avoid excessive noise 
  due to distant high-contrast objects.

  <dt>fallof<dd> sets the rate for fading into the environment, which is a
  power function. The default of 2.0 means the falloff is by distance squared;
  3.0 means distance cubed, and so on. This parameter has no effect if
  <var>max_distance</var> is zero.
  
  <dt>environment_color<dd> is the multiplier for when the ray misses any
  object and hits the environment. For physical accuracy, this should be
  exactly the same as the <var>reflection_color</var>, but is provided
  separately to give greater control in balancing the brightness between
  reflection of objects and reflection of the environment.
  
  <dt>reflection_base_weight<dd> is a scalar multiplier for the reflection
  at surfaces facing the camera, and <var>reflection_edge_weight</var> at
  surfaces perpendicular to the camera (i.e. edges), and 
  <var>edge_factor</var> the narrowness of this "edge". Generally there are
  more reflections at edges (glancing angles) than on facing surfaces, known
  as a "fresnel effect".
  
  <dt>environment<dd> parameter allows passing an explicit environment
  shader that only applies to <em>this</em> shader. If none is passed, the
  material's environment shader is used, with the global camera environment
  as a fallback. This allows the use of a specially prepared pre-blurred
  environment map for environment reflections.
  <dd>
  If the environment map is already sufficiently blurry, it may be
  wasteful (performance wise), and it may also introduce unnecessary sampling noise
  when sampling the environment multiple times. When <var>single_env_sample</var> 
  is off, an environment sample is made for each reflection ray that misses an 
  object or needs to  be mixed with the environment due to the use of
  <var>max_distance</var>. When on, the environment is sampled only once
  for these reflection rays.
  
  <dt>samples<dd> sets the number of samples used, and is ideally a power of
  two. If zero, the shader reverts to single sample mirror reflection only.
  
  <dt>u_spread<br>v_spread<dd> is the amount of normal 
  vector perturbation performed in the U and V direction. If these values
  are <em>identical</em>, isotropic glossy reflection is generated. Upon any
  difference between the two values, the anisotropic mode is enabled.
  
  <dt>u_axis
  <br>v_axis
  <dd> are optional parameters for specifying
  the directions of anisotropy. These <em>only</em> apply in anisotropic mode.
  If <var>u_axis</var> is 0,0,0 the shader attempts to generate a default vector
  based on the first derivative vector of the surface, and if such is missing,
  based on object-space X axis.
  If <var>u_axis</var> is given a value it is utilized as the U direction of
  anisotropy. If <var>v_axis</var> is also specified it is used as the V direction,
  but if left unspecified the V direction is calculated as the cross product
  of the original surface normal and the U direction.
  
  <dt>dispersion<dd> reaches from 0.0 (no chromatic aberration) to 1.0
  (full spectrum chromatic abberation).
  
  <dt>spectrum<dd> is an array of colors defining the "rainbow" into
  which colors are broken when the <var>dispersion</var> parameter is nonzero. It
  defaults to a default red-yellow-white-cyan-blue-indigo colors but can be
  anything.

<dl>
  <dt>top_material<dd> is the surface characteristics of the very top
  layer. Like the <var>base_material</var> in the reflection version of this
  shader, this is simply added to the result. An example use would be
  <i><a href="node8.html#mi_shader__mib_illum_phong">mib_illum_phong</a></i>
  with only specularity and very little to no diffuse component.

  <dt>deep_material<dd> is only used if <var>max_distance</var> is 
  nonzero. It is the surface characteristics of the "interior" of the 
  object, and the color to which refractions fade as they reach the
  <var>max_distance</var>. While the color is still <em>calculated</em> 
  at the surface, it will "appear" to be behind any refraction of
  internal objects. For interesting pseudo-volumetric simulations 
  one can suggest using the misss_fast_* subsurface scattering 
  shader here.
  
  <dt>back_material<dd> is the material used for rays that hit
  the inside of the object from within (i.e. any ray that hits the
  object from the back as defined by the geometry normal). It defines
  what the "inside" of the object looks like, and should just like
  the preceeding parameters be assigned to a surface shader, e.g.
  <em>mib_illum_phong</em> or similar.
  By default mental ray flips the normal to the side of the incoming 
  ray, which would render the <em>inside</em> of the objects surface. 
  But sometimes it is desirable to simulate a translucency 
  effect by letting the light hitting the <em>outside</em> of the object
  define its shading. This is accomplished by turning 
  <var>render_reverse_of_back_material</var> on, which causes the
  shader to use the original direction of the surface normal when 
  evaluating <var>back_material</var>.

  <dt>refraction_color<dd> is simply a multiplier for the refracted
  rays. 
  
  <dt>max_distance<dd> limits the reach of refracted rays, and fades
  them toward the <var>deep_material</var> as their length approaches the
  <var>max_distance</var>. This gives the appearance of a 
  semi-transparent material into which one can only see so far.
  
  <dt>falloff<dd> sets the rate for fading into the <var>deep_material</var>,
  which is a power function. The default of 2.0 means the falloff is by
  distance squared; 3.0 means distance cubed, and so on. This parameter
  has no effect if <var>max_distance</var> is zero.

  <dt>refraction_base_weight<dd> is a scalar multiplier for the refraction
  at surfaces facing the camera, and <var>refraction_edge_weight</var>, at
  surfaces perpendicular to the camera (i.e. edges).
  <var>edge_factor</var> is the narrowness of this "edge". Generally, there is
  <em>less</em> refraction at edges (glancing angles) than there is on facing surfaces. 
  This is known as a "fresnel effect".

  <dt>ior<dd> is the index of refraction. Since the perturbation of
  refraction is calculated based on a perturbed normal vector, it is
  <em>very important</em> that this value defines a sensible index of
  refraction... otherwise an index of 1.0 causes no change in the ray
  direction, generating no blurriness whatsoever!
  As a special case, one may set <var>ior</var> to 0.0 which will switch
  to a "direction perturbing mode" rather than a "normal perturbing 
  mode".
  
  <dt>samples<dd> sets the number of samples used, and is ideally a power of
  two. If zero, the shader reverts to single sample refraction only.
  
  <dt>u_spread<br>v_spread<dd> is the amount of normal 
  vector perturbation performed in the U and V direction. If these values
  are <em>identical</em>, isotropic glossy refraction is generated. Upon any
  difference between the two values, the anisotropic mode is enabled.

  <dt>u_axis<br>v_axis<dd> are optional parameters for specifying
  the directions of anisotropy. These <em>only</em> apply in anisotropic mode.
  If <var>u_axis</var> is 0,0,0 the shader attempts to generate a default vector
  based on the first derivative vector of the surface, and if such is missing,
  based on object-space X axis.
  If <var>u_axis</var> is given a value it is utilized as the U direction of
  anisotropy. If <var>v_axis</var> is also specified it is used as the V direction,
  but if left unspecified the V direction is calculated as the cross product
  of the original surface normal and the U direction.
  
  <dt>dispersion<dd> parameter reaches from 0.0 (no chromatic aberration)
  to 1.0 (full spectrum chromatic abberation).
  
  <dt>spectrum<dd> is an array of colors defining the "rainbow" into
  which colors are broken when the <var>dispersion</var> parameter is nonzero. It
  defaults to a default red-yellow-white-cyan-blue-indigo colors but can be
  anything.
