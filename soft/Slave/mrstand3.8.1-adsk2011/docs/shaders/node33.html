  <h3>Fast Scatter</h3>
  <p>
  This is the main shader that does the actual scattering. It is highly
  modular and works with several plug-in shaders, and it can even be
  cascaded into itself for multi-layer scattering (as is done in
  <i><a href="node32.html#INDEX95">misss_fast_skin_phen</a></i>).
  It layers the results from the plug-in shaders with the scattered light
  from the lightmap (optionally nonlinearly, in what is known as "screen"
  transfer mode in various compositing applications) and presents the
  result as a final composited color.</p>

  <dt>lightmap<br>depthmap<dd>are the light and depthmap pair from which
  to extract the data. For more details, read about
  <i><a href="node33.html#INDEX98">misss_lightmap_write</a></i> and the section
  on <a href="node34.html#misss:autolightmap">Automatic lightmap generation</a>.

  <dt>bump<dd>is a shader that perturbs the normal. While one could use a
  shader list and something like <i>mib_bump_passthrough</i> before this
  shader, for large scattering radii it is preferred that the shader is
  aware of the normal vector before bump mapping. When a bump mapping shader
  is assigned to this parameter instead,
  <i><a href="node33.html#INDEX97">misss_fast_shader</a></i> will know the
  normal both before and after bump mapping.

  <dt>diffuse_illum<dd> passes any normal illumination shader (returning a color)
  for the diffuse illumination, generally a named shader based on
  <i><a href="node8.html#INDEX28">mib_illum_lambert</a></i>. If nothing is
  passed, it automatically defaults to Lambert.

  <dt>diffuse_color<dd> is an overall color that is applied to
  all diffuse light, including the scattered contributions.

  <dt>specular_illum<dd> passes any normal illumination shader
  (returning a color) for the specular and reflective components.
  If nothing is passed, no specular shading happens. This is
  layered on top of any diffuse contributions.

  <dt>diffuse_weight<dd> is a simple scalar multiplier for the
  color returned by the <i>diffuse_illum</i> shader, for easier
  tweaking.

  <dt>front_sss_color<br>front_sss_weight<dd> are the
  color and weight for the front surface scattering.

  <dt>front_sss_radius<dd> is the scatter radius in the front
  surface. Light will scatter this distance (in whatever units the
  model is made) along the surface.

  <dt>back_sss_color<br>back_sss_weight<dd> are the color
  and weight of the back surface (or through) scattering.

  <dt>back_sss_radius<dd> is the scatter radius and
  <var>back_sss_depth</var> the depth in the back surface. Generally,
  the radius and depth are set to the same value (and if the depth
  is not specified, it defaults to the radius) but can be set
  separately for increased control.

  <dt>scale_conversion<dd> is a simple utility function allowing
  linear division of all distances. Since scattering is distance
  dependent, loading a material designed for a model made in inches
  will not work on a model where the unit is meters, and vice
  versa. Here one can pass the conversion factor.

  <dt>screen_composit<dd> when turned on, chooses Screen
  compositing. When simply adding together the contribution of many
  layers of light, it is very easy to quickly blow out and
  overexpose into white, but the human eye is inherently nonlinear
  and perceives intensities in a different way. This option allows
  use of what is known in many compositing applications as a screen
  transfer mode between the layers, which yields a softer, more
  pleasing result. If it is turned off, normal addition is used. If
  rendering in a high dynamic range, and a proper tone-operator is
  applied in the final output stage already compressing the final
  luminance, use off. If not, turning this option on yields a more
  pleasing result.

  <dt>output_sss_only<dd> is for debugging and testing or for
  preparing for external compositing; If it is on, only the
  scattered contribution is shown.

  <dt>falloff<dd> sets the shape of the distance falloff along
  the scatter radius. Higher values yield a sharper falloff, and
  lower values a smoother falloff, but also make the perceived
  scatter distance shorter, so one must compensate by increasing
  the actual scatter distance for a slightly softer look. For high
  values (1.0 to 10.0), almost all samples within the scatter
  radius are weighted equally. For low values (0.1 to 1.0), the
  samples near the edge of the scatter radius are weighted a
  less.

  <dt>samples<dd> sets how many samples from the lightmap are
  considered (maximum) per rendered ray, ideally, a power of two.
  32 is probably the lowest useful value, 128 is plenty.

  <p>
  This shader has identical behavior to <a href="">misss_fast_shader</a>
  but provides individual components of the shading results as output
  values before compositing them into the final color value. This supports
  multi-channel rendering approaches where compositing is performed in
  external packages.

<p>
  The <i><a href="node33.html#INDEX97">misss_fast_shader</a></i>
  works conceptually with the layering of several light
  contributions, all stacked on top of each other. The actual
  compositing can be done with simple addition or with the softer
  looking screen compositing.

<div class="pic">
<img src="images/subsurf_concept.jpg" />
<br>Conceptual layering of misss_fast_shader</div>

  <p>Plug-in shaders provide the actual contribution for the
  various layers. <var>bump</var>, <var>diffuse_illum</var> and
  <var>specular_illum</var> are the main plugin shaders that provide
  the shading model.

  <p>The <var>bump</var> shader affects the surface normal and is
  called before the "... <var>_illum</var>" shaders and hence affects
  their shading. However, no bump mapping is performed on the
  scattered light, since this happens <i>under</i> the surface. It
  is possible to include the effect of bump mapping in the light
  <i>before</i> it is scattered by including a bump map shader in
  the lightmapping phase.

  <p>To create the subsurface scattering itself, light from
  specially prepared lightmaps is gathered, weighted by distance,
  and tinted. The whole stack is finally layered together as
  follows, from top to bottom.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Layer 1: What the <var>specular_illum</var> shader returns.
    <li>Layer 2: What the <var>diffuse_illum</var> shader returns.
    <li>Layer 3: The front layer, which is the scattering within
    the facing side of the object.
    <li>Layer 4: The back layer, which is light shining through the  object.
  </ul>

  <p>The following two observations are noteworthy: First, keep in
  mind that the contributions from layers 2, 3 and 4 are all
  multiplied with the " <var>diffuse_color</var>" parameter as an
  overall tinting and attenuation color for the diffuse
  contributions. Second, since the plugin shaders are simply called
  and layered in, it is possible to cascade several shaders
  together to create multiple layers as follows:</p>

<div class="pic">
<img src="images/subsurf_cascading.jpg" />
<br />Cascading of misss_fast_shader</div>

  <p>This graph shows how a 2nd iteration of
  <i><a href="node33.html#INDEX97">misss_fast_shader</a></i> is used as the
  <i>diffuse_illum</i> parameter of the 1st. This works because the
  scattering function receives its diffuse illumination from the
  lightmaps, and does not care about what <var>diffuse_illum</var>
  actually returns. It simply layers it into the mix.</p>

  <p>This is precisely how the skin Phenomenon is implemented. A
  second shader is cascaded into the first, giving an extra layer.
  In principle, there is nothing preventing the stacking of an
  arbitrary number of shaders.</p>

  <a id="INDEX98"></a>
  <h3>Lightmap Creation</h3>
<p>
  This is the lightmapping shader. It is required for the fast subsurface
  scattering to work <a href="#FOOTNOTE1">[1]</a>. It creates a lightmap
  and stores the front and back surfaces, their depth, and irradiant
  light intensities in one or more specially formatted lightmaps.
  Two modes of behavior are supported:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
    <li>Passing a single writable texture that must be floating
    point (32 bits) to the <i>lightmap</i> parameter.

    <li>Passing a <i>lightmap_group</i> and a <i>lightmap_size</i>,
    causing the internal creation of an in-memory light and depthmap
    pair. To use this option, the shader must be enclosed in a
    Phenomenon where the lightmap and depthmap are the first two
    parameters. See <a href="node34.html#misss:autolightmap">
    Automatic lightmap generation</a>.

  <a href="node34.html#misss:autolightmap">Automatic lightmap generation</a>.

  <dt>lightmap_group<dd> is a string with a scatter group name
  with automatic lightmap generation. All objects and materials
  that use the same scatter group will scatter light into each
  other.

  <dt>lightmap_size<dd> is the size, in percent of render size,
  for the automatically generated lightmap.

  <dt>write_lightmap<dd> is currently reserved for future use.

  <dt>scatter_bias<dd> adjusts the light in the lightmap to favor
  back scattering (light from behind the camera scatters back
  towards the camera) when using negative values and forward
  scattering when using positive values. The technical range is -1
  to 1, but generally only small values (-0.2 to 0.2) make visual
  sense.

  <dt>input<dd> is the shader that actually samples the lighting
  in the model for the lightmap. Generally
  <i><a href="node33.html#INDEX99">misss_lambert_gamma</a></i> is used, but
  any illumination shader can be used, for example
  <i><a href="node8.html#INDEX28">mib_illum_lambert</a></i> or even experiment

  <h3>Lambert Illumination</h3>

  <p>This is the supplied lightmap sampling shader. Any illumination shader
  can be used like <i><a href="node8.html#INDEX28">mib_illum_lambert</a></i>
  but this one is specially tuned for the job and has additional options for
  lightmap gamma correction, normal flipping and indirect light inclusion.</p>

  <dt>diffuse<dd> is the diffuse color.
  
  <dt>ambient<br>ambience<dd> are
  multiplied with each other to yield a final contribution of
  ambient light.

  <dt>indirect<dd>if on, will cause indirect illumination (such
  as final gathering and photons) to be included in the lightmap,
  at the expense of increased rendering time.

  <dt>diffuse_curve<dd> is the gamma curve for diffuse light. The
  Lambertian cosine is raised to the power of this value (i.e.
  <b>pow(dot_nl, diffuse_curve)</b>) to flatten (for values less
  than 1.0) or narrow (for values above 1.0) the curve for greater
  control.

  <dt>flip<dd> can be one of the following: 0, normals are not
  flipped; 1, normals are flipped; or 2, both the unflipped and
  flipped-normal sides are lightmapped. This can be useful for
  translucency in thin objects such as leaves.

  <dt>mode<dd> is the mode selector for the

  <h3>Specular Skin</h3>

  <p>This is a function geared towards recreating the peculiar specular
  characteristics of skin. It contains two specular highlights and glossy
  reflections with edge enhancement.</p>

  <p>The shader can be used anywhere where specular highlights are
  needed. It has no diffuse component and hence needs to be layered
  together with another shader that provides the diffuse shading.</p>

  <dt>overall_weight
  <dd> is the overall level of specularity and
  reflections. Generally, any specularity map is included here and
  will affect the level of all specularity options that follow
  below.

  <dt>edge_factor
  <dd> sets the edge width of the edge reflection
  effects. Skin reflects more when watched in angles nearly
  perpendicular to it (known as a "Fresnel effect") and this
  parameter sets the narrowness of this edge. Higher values yield a
  thinner edge. This edge width applies to all the edge weights
  listed below.

  <dt>primary_spec_color
  <br>primary_spec_weight
  <dd> are the color and base weight for the first layer of specularity.
  The skin specularity functions are two-layered, allowing simulation
  of both the broad soft specularity of skin and any
  near-reflective specularities of top layer oiliness and
  wetness.

  <dt>primary_edge_weight
  <dd> sets the additional multiplier for
  the edge, where final specularity at the edge is the sum of
  <var>weight</var> and <var>edge weight</var>.

  <dt>primary_shinyness
  <dd> is the specular exponent (higher
  values yield a smaller and sharper specular highlight, which is a
  modified Phong with edge softening).

  <dt>secondary_spec_color
  <br>secondary_spec_weight
  <br>secondary_edge_weight
  <br>secondary_shinyness
  <dd> work exactly like the parameters that begin with <i>primary_</i>
  and are for the second layer of specularity.

  <dt>reflect_weight
  <br>reflect_edge_weight
  <dd> the weight and edge weight for reflections. If it is nonzero, then
  actual (glossy) reflections are added.

  <dt>reflect_shinyness
  <dd> is the shinyness value for glossy reflections. When it is 0.0,
  standard raytraced mirror reflections are used, but for nonzero values
  glossy reflections are generated, which increases render time.

  <dt>reflect_environment_only
  <dd> if true only the current environment map is sampled for reflections,
  and no actual rays are traced.

  <dt>mode
  <dd> is the mode selector for the
  <a href="node8.html#lightlists">light lists</a>.

  <dt>lights
  <dd> array of lights directly linked to the shader.

  <h3>Call Shader</h3>

  <p>
  This is a utility "pass through" shader for Phenomenon building. It allows
  passing shaders as parameters to material Phenomena for items
  such as environment, photons, and displacement.</p>
