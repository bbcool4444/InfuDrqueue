  <h2>Participating Media</h2>

  <p>Fog, clouds, silty water, and similar media scatter some of
  the light that travels through it. In other words, these media
  participate in the light transport (see [Jensen 98]). A volume
  shader is needed to simulate participating media.</p>

  <h3>Volume Shader</h3>

  <p>The volume shader <i>parti_volume</i> can simulate homogeneous
  (uniform density) and nonhomogeneous participating media with
  isotropic (diffuse) or anisotropic scattering.
  <i><a href="node22.html#INDEX71">parti_volume</a></i> and
  <i><a href="node23.html#INDEX73">parti_volume_photon</a></i> use a two-lobed
  scattering model, which means that light scatters both forward
  and back in the incoming light direction. This scattering model
  is invented by Ch. Schlick and can model real scattering from
  dust, mist, rain-drops, etc.</p>

  <p>Any medium (other than a vacuum) is assumed to contain
  suspended particles which scatter light traveling through it.
  Scattering plays an important role in the shading of volumes, and
  it is the size of the particles in relation to the wavelength of
  light which determines the type of scattering. If the particle
  radii are much smaller than the wavelength of light, there is no
  discernible scattering and the light is absorbed. Particles only
  slightly smaller than the wavelength of light produce what is
  known as Rayleigh scattering (cigarette smoke and dust).
  Particles roughly the same size as the wavelength of light give
  rise to Mie scattering (water droplets or fog). The Mie model can
  account for both sparse and dense particle densities, referred to
  as Hazy Mie and Murky Mie respectively. When the particle size is
  much larger than the wavelength of light, geometric optics comes
  into effect (normal solid surfaces). Glassner suggests the
  following values:</p>

  <table class="table">
  <tr>
  <th>function<th>r<th>g1<th>g2
  </tr><tr>
  <td>Rayleigh<td>0.50<td>-0.46<td>0.46
  </tr><tr>
  <td>Hazy Mie<td>0.12<td>-0.50<td>0.70
  </tr><tr>
  <td>Murky Mie<td>0.19<td>-0.65<td>0.91

<dl>
  <dt>mode<dd>in mode 0, the participating medium fills the
  entire volume. In mode 1, there is only participation medium
  below the given height, and there is clear air or vacuum above.

  <dt>scatter<dd> is the color of the scattering medium. This determines the
  color of the direct and indirect light that is scattered by the medium. It
  also acts as a multiplier of the photon energy for the photons in the photon
  volume map. Its dependency with the extintion coefficient is inverse.

  <dt>extinction<dd> is the extinction coefficient of the medium.
  It determines how much light is absorbed or scattered in the
  medium. 0 means clear air or vacuum. The higher the coefficient,
  the denser the medium (and the more photon scattering). Note that a high extinction
  coefficient doesnt allow photons to enter deep into the volume, as
  they are already scattered after a short distance.

  <dt>r<br>g1<br>g2<dd> control scattering. If both
  g1 and g2 are zero (the default), isotropic scattering is
  modeled: all scattering directions have equal probability. This
  is sometimes also called diffuse scattering. Anisotropic
  reflection is modeled by a two-lobed scattering model. Each lobe
  can be either backscattering ( <i>-1 &lt; g &lt;
  0</i>), diffuse (isotropic, <i>g = 0</i>), or forward scattering
  ( <i>0 &lt; g &lt;
  1</i>). The first lobe is weighted by <i>r</i>, the second lobe
  by <i>1 - r</i>.

  <dt>nonuniform<dd> determines if the medium is homogeneous
  (uniform density) or nonhomogeneous (cloud-like density
  variation). It is a number between 0 and 1. A value of 0 makes
  the medium is completely homogeneous and depends only on the
  extinction parameter. A value of 1 creates a cloud-like Blinn
  density variation. Values between 0 and 1 give a mix between the
  two extremes.

  <dt>height<dd> determines the height above which there is clear
  air or vacuum if the mode parameter is 1.

  <dt>min_step_len<br>max_step_len<dd> are used to determine the
  step length for ray marching. Usually keep the min value at 10 percent
  of max. The smaller the max is, the more accurately, though slowly,
  the volume steps will be sampled for visibility. The same parameter
  is used in
  <i><a href="node23.html#mi_shader__parti_volume_photon">parti_volume_photon</a></i>
  for volume photon lookup.

  <dt>light_dist<dd> is used for optimization of the sampling of
  area light sources. It is used if the area light source has the
  optional lower sampling, as in for example
<pre>
    rectangle  0.5 0.0 0.0  0.0 0.0 0.5   10 10 3 2 2 
</pre>

  <dd>For efficiency, <i>parti_volume</i> always uses the lower
  number of samples (here 2 2). This is usually sufficient since
  the direct illumination is computed at many points along each ray
  during ray marching. However, the higher number of samples (here
  10 10) should be used near an area light source. The light_dist
  parameter determines how far away from a light source the higher
  number of samples have to be used.</p>

  <dt>min_level<dd> is ignored (it is used by the corresponding
  volume photon shader).</p>

  <dt>no_globil_where_direct<dd> tells the shader to not calculate
  global illumination in the volume effect but just the direct
  illumination. The parameter is for optimization if such contribution
  is not required. When set to 1 (on) the parameters relative to the
  directionality of the scattering effect, <var>r</var>, <var>g1</var>, and 
  <var>g2</var> are not taken into account for the indirect illumination, 
  they are however evaluated for direct illumination.</p>

  <dt>lights<dd> is an array of light instances. 
  If no lights are specified then the light list 
  in the geometry instance is used. If no instance light list is specified
  then all lights in the scene are used.</p>

  <h3>Transparent Material</h3>

  <p><span class="depr">Deprecated</span> This is a material shader for a helper
  enclosing surface of a participating medium or volume that is not a mental ray
  <dfn>hull</dfn> object. It simply continues to trace the incoming ray in the
  same direction without any interaction with the current object. Such a volume
  container should be invisible itself.</p>
