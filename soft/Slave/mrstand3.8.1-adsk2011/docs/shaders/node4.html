<h2>Texture Space Mapping</h2>

<p>These shaders take care of selecting, creating, and remapping
texture spaces, computing basis vectors, and other tasks
necessary before a color or displacement can be applied. Some of
these functions have a <var>select</var> parameter that has one of
the following values:</p>

<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>0..63</td>
<td>selects a texture vector. If this exceeds the number of
defined texture spaces, default to -1 (the point in space).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&minus;1</td>
<td>selects the 3D point in space directly, and may apply a
space point transformation.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&minus;2</td>
<td>selects the normal vector, and may apply a space vector
transformation.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&minus;3</td>
<td>selects the motion vector, and may apply a space vector
transformation.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&minus;4</td>
<td>selects the ray direction, and may apply a space vector
transformation.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&minus;5..&minus;9</td>
<td>select a surface derivative vector, and may apply a
space vector transformation. The values are
<span class="math">
&part;<b>P</b>&frasl;&part;<b>U</b>,
&part;<b>P</b>&frasl;&part;<b>V</b>,
&part;&sup2;<b>P</b>&frasl;&part;<b>U</b>&sup2;,
&part;&sup2;<b>P</b>&frasl;&part;<b>V</b>&sup2;, and
&part;&sup2;<b>P</b>&frasl;(&part;<b>U</b>&part;<b>V</b>).
</span> The object must be defined to contain derivatives.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&minus;10</td>
<td>selects a 2D background plate coordinate with (0, 0, 0) in the lower
left corner of the screen, and (1, 1, 0) just outside the upper right corner
of the screen. <var>selspace</var> has no effect in this mode. The transformation
is similar to the one in <i>mib_lookup_background</i>.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&minus;11</td>
<td>selects the texture coordinate in the state, where it is typically put
by a material shader when evaluating a parameter of type texture, for use
by a texture shader.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Space transformations allow transforming the vector that the
projection is based on into object, world, or camera coordinates.
<var>selspace</var> may have the following values:</p>

<table class="table">
<tr><td>0</td><td>does not apply a transformation, using internal space.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>converts the vector into object space.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>converts the vector into world space.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>converts the vector into camera space.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>returns the current screen space coordinates in the interval
<i>[0,0 ... 1,1)</i>.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>An additional projection can be applied to the
resulting vector by setting the <var>project</var> parameter:</p>

<table class="table">
<tr><td>0</td><td>disables projections.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>selects an UV projection if available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>selects an orthographic XY projection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>selects an orthographic XZ projection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>selects an orthographic YZ projection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>selects a spherical projection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>selects a cylindrical projection. <i>U=0</i> is at +X,
and <i>V=0</i> is at +Y. Y is also the cylinder axis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>selects the lollipop projection, which puts the center
of the texture (after texture vector normalization) at
X=0.5 Z=1, and the corners at the parameter corners. On a
sphere, the texture center is at the north pole and the
texture corners are at the south pole, like a lollipop
wrapper.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Texture Vertex Generator</h3>

<p>Return a texture vector derived from orthographic projections
of the 3D point in space (XY, XZ, YZ), non-orthographic
projections (spherical or cylindrical); or return a numbered
texture vector from the texture vector list. Optionally, this
shader can base its calculations on object, camera, world, or
screen space.</p>

    vector "mib_texture_vector" (
        integer         "select",
        integer         "selspace",
        integer         "vertex",
        integer         "project")
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>select<dd> specifies the value to look up, as described above.

  <dt>selspace<dd> allows choosing the source space for
  projections, as described above. Space conversion is done before
  the projection specified by the select parameter. If selspace is
  4 (screen space), select, vertex, and project are ignored.

  <dt>vertex<dd> specifies the location of the vertex: 0 is the
  intersection point, and 1, 2, and 3 are the vertices of the
  intersected triangle. It has no effect if select is -10.

  <dt>project<dd> specifies a projection that is performed after
  selection and space conversion. It has no effect if select is
  -10.
</dl>

  <h3>Texture Vertex Remapping</h3>

  <p>Accepts a texture vertex and scales, rotates, translates,
  crops, and joins textures. The order of operations is transform
  first, then repeat, alternate, torus, and finally min/max crop.
  The result is returned (and stored in <tt>state&rarr;tex</tt>
  where it can be picked up by other shaders).</p>

<a id="INDEX3"></a>
<h5 id="mi_shader__mib_texture_remap">mib_texture_remap</h5>
  <pre>
    vector "mib_texture_remap" (
        vector          "input",
        transform       "transform",
        vector          "repeat",
        boolean         "alt_x",
        boolean         "alt_y",
        boolean         "alt_z",
        boolean         "torus_x",
        boolean         "torus_y",
        boolean         "torus_z",
        vector          "min",
        vector          "max",
        vector	        "offset")
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>input<dd> is a texture vector from a generator such as
  <i>mib_texture_vector</i> that returns texture vectors.
  <i>input</i> is overridden when this shader is called with a
  nonzero <i>arg</i> parameter in <i>mi_call_shader_x</i>. This is
  useful for remapping multiple texture coordinates when the
  remapping parameters are identical for all of them.

  <dt>transform<dd> is a general transformation applied to the
  texture vector before the remaining parameters are applied. If
  transform[3][3] is 0.0, the matrix is ignored (normally
  transform[3][3] is 1.0).

  <dt>repeat<dd> contains repetition factors in X, Y, and Z that
  the texture vector is multiplied with. A value of 2, for example,
  shrinks the texture such that it fits twice in the <i>[0, 1)</i>
  interval. Repeating has no effect outside this interval. After
  the multiplication by the repetition factor, the integer part is
  removed. This algorithm allows finite repetition in an interval
  determined by the transform parameter. A repetition value of 0
  turns off repetition in the corresponding component, as if the
  value were 1.

  <dt>alt_*<dd> specifies whether every other copy of the
  repetition would be reversed such that successive copies of the
  texture are traversed in alternate, back-and-forth directions.
  Alternate flags have an effect only if the corresponding
  repetition component is greater than 1, and also work only in the
  <i>[0, 1)</i> interval.

  <dt>torus_*<dd> maps the texture space into the range <i>[0,
  1)</i> such that values less than 0 and equal to or greater than
  1 are put into this range by cutting off the integer part.

  <dt>min<br>max<dd> implement image or volume cropping
  by specifying the range of the texture to be considered. Portions
  of the texture outside this range are trimmed off. If repetition
  is used, the max point of one copy joins the min point of the
  next copy (unless alternation is turned on). min is inclusive,
  max is exclusive. If a min component is equal to the
  corresponding max component, both are ignored.

  <dt>offset<dd> is a vector added to the texture vector
  before the texture lookup.
</dl>

  <h3>Rotation of Surface Orientation</h3>

  <p>An angle is used to rotate the surface orientation around the
  surface normal. An orthogonal vector pair is returned that,
  together with the normal which both are orthogonal to, define the
  rotated orientation. This is especially useful for anisotropic
  reflection (see below).</p>

<a id="INDEX4"></a>
<h5 id="mi_shader__mib_texture_rotate">mib_texture_rotate</h5>
  <pre>
    struct {
        vector          "u",
        vector          "v"
    } "mib_texture_rotate" (
        vector          "input",
        scalar          "angle",
        scalar          "min",
        scalar          "max")
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>u<br>v<dd> are the returned orthogonal vectors.

  <dt>input<dd> is the texture vector to be rotated. It is
  expected in internal space.

  <dt>angle<dd> is a scalar that is interpreted as a rotation. A
  value equal to min specifies no rotation, and a value equal to
  max specifies a 360-degree rotation. The angle can for example be
  the intensity from a texture lookup.

  <dt>min<br>max<dd> specify the value limits
  corresponding to no and full rotation. An angle value &alpha; is first
  mapped to <span class="math">&alpha;&lowast;(max&minus;min)+min</span>.
  If min and max are both 0, they default to 0 and 0.25,
  corresponding to 0 and 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
</dl>

  <h3>Bump Basis
  Generator</h3>

  <p>Given the intersection point, compute a pair of bump basis
  vectors, based on the projection method (as above: UV, XY, XZ,
  YZ, spherical, or cylindrical).</p>

<a id="INDEX5"></a>
<h5 id="mi_shader__mib_bump_basis">mib_bump_basis</h5>
  <pre>
    struct {
        vector          "u",
        vector          "v"
    } "mib_bump_basis" (
        integer         "project",
        integer         "ntex")
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>project<dd> specifies the projection to perform, as
  described above. All projections are based on the 3D point in
  space after conversion to object space. This parameter is used to
  orient the bump basis.

  <dt>ntex<dd> is the texture space to use, in the range <i>0 ...
  63</i>. It is used only if project is UV (5) or disabled (0 or
  negative). Otherwise ntex is ignored.</p>
</dl>

  <h3>Bump Mapping</h3>

  <p>Apply a texture to the normal vector by evaluating the texture
  at multiple points to compute U and V gradients that are
  multiplied with the basis vectors, combined with the original
  normal, normalized, and written back. Also return the normal.
  <TT>state&rarr;tex</TT> is left undefined.</p>

        vector          "v",
        vector          "coord",
        vector          "step",
        scalar          "factor",
        boolean         "torus_u",
        boolean         "torus_v",
        boolean         "alpha",
        color texture   "tex",
        boolean         "clamp")
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>u<br>v<dd> are the bump basis vectors. They can be
  generated from another base shader such as
  <i>mib_bump_basis</i>.

  <dt>coord<dd> is the texture coordinate for which the bump
  should be calculated.

  <dt>step<dd> are offsets to coord. The shader samples three
  times: at <i>(coord_x, coord_v)</i>, at <i>(coord_x + step_x,
  coord_v)</i>, and at <i>(coord_x, coord_v + step_v)</i>. The
  resulting U and V gradients are multiplied by the u and v basis
  vectors, respectively, then multiplied by the factor, and finally
  added to the normal, which is then renormalized. If the step
  components are 0, they default to 0.01.

  <dt>factor<dd> controls the strength of the effect. If it is 0,
  it defaults to 1.

  <dt>torus_u<br>torus_v<dd> specify that, when step is
  added to coord, the result (X, Y, and Z) should be wrapped back
  into the interval <i>[0 ... 1)</i>.

  <dt>alpha<dd>if true, specifies that the alpha component
  instead of the intensity of the color texture should be used.

  <dt>tex<dd> is a color texture or shader to look up three
  times. (Only use shader assignment using the "=" notation if
  the assigned shader returns a shader.)

  <dt>clamp<dd>if true, restricts bump mapping area to the
  [0, 1] texture coordinate range.
</dl>

<hr width="0">

  <p>The following shader is identical to the previous, including
  the parameters, except that it returns a color instead of a
  vector. This color is not modified. This allows the shader to be
  used in material shader lists by prepending it to the actual
  material shader. In this configuration it is called first and
  modifies the normal vector in the state before the material
  shader uses it to compute illumination. At the same time, it does
  not in any way affect the computed result color.</p>

  <p>See above for a description of the parameters.</p>

<hr width="0">

<p>This is a another approach of a bump map shader, which differs from the
previous ones by modifying the <TT>state&rarr;normal</TT> and then evaluating
any shading graph connected to the <TT>color</TT> input. This way the perturbed
normal will be visible to the connected shader or tree. Typically, illumination
shaders such as Phong should be connected to the <TT>color</TT> parameter.
</P>

<P>The bump map will look at 3 texture samples from the texture, using the 
texture space 0. The differences of the 3 returned values indicate the 
bending of the normal. The normal will be bent in the direction of the 
<i>bump_vectors</i> if they exist, or in the direction of the derivatives otherwise. The 
modified normal is saved in the <TT>state</TT> before calling the evaluation 
of <TT>color</TT>. All shaders attached to <tt>color</tt> will then used this modified normal. 
The normal is set back to its original value at the end.</P>
