  <p>The optical properties controlling the subsurface scattering
  shader are surface color, transmission color, refractive index,
  scattering and absorption coefficients, and the scattering
  function:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>material
  <dd> provides the material shader which determines
  the appearance of the material and the shading model to apply at
  a surface level.

  <dt>transmission
  <dd> is the transmission color or texture
  shader that filters light as it enters the object.

  <dt>ior
  <dd> is the index of refraction of the material, which
  determines how light changes direction as it enters or leaves the
  material.

  <dt>absorption_coeff
  <dd> is a measure of light attenuation as
  it passes through a turbid medium. Usually expressed in units of
  inverse length such that the product of the absorption
  coefficient and path length of a photon's travel through the
  medium is dimensionless. The probability of transmission
  is <span class="math">e<sup>-aL</sup></span> where
  <span class="math">a</span> is the absorption coefficient and
  <span class="math">L</span> is the path length. When using
  a coefficient that has been experimentally obtained, it is important
  to specify a correct scale conversion ratio between coefficient units
  and world units. Absorption is wavelength dependent.

  <dt>scattering_coeff
  <dd> is a measure of light scattering as
  it passes through a volume. This is usually expressed in units
  of inverse length so that the product of the scattering coefficient
  and path length of a photon's travel through the volume is dimensionless.
  The probability of transmission without redirection is
  <span class="math">e<sup>-sL</sup></span> where <span class="math">s</span>
  is the scattering coefficient and <span class="math">L</span> is
  the path length. When using a coefficient that has been experimentally
  obtained, it is important to specify a correct scale conversion
  ratio between the coefficient units and the world units.
  Scattering is wavelength dependent.
  <dd>
  The table below gives suggested scattering and absorption
  coefficients (based on empirical data) for several materials.

  <dt>scale_conversion<dd> is a transform between the world
  coordinate system and the units used to represent the scattering
  and absorption coefficients. For example, if the world coordinate
  system is expressed in inches and the coefficients are in
  millimeters, then the correct scale factor is 25.4 (mm/inch).</p>

  <dt>scattering_anisotropy<dd> is a measure of the degree of
  scattering. Specifically, it is the average dot product between
  the incident light direction and the scattered light direction.
  Most turbid materials do not scatter light uniformly. Values may
  range from -1 to 1. Where -1 corresponds to back scatter only and
  1 corresponds to forward scatter only. The value 0 indicates
  uniform scattering in all directions.
