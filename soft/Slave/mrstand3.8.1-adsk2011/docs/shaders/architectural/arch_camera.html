<p>
When rendering physical light levels one runs into the problem of managing
the HDRI output of the real physics vs. the limited dynamic range of computer
displays. This was discussed in more detail on page <a href="arch_mtl.html#Gamma">Gamma</a>.
<div class="pic">
<img width="80%" src="images/toneop-notoneop.jpg" alt="Going from this..."><br />Going from this...<br /><img width="80%" src="images/toneop-portal-05.jpg" alt="...to this."><br />...to this.<br /></div>
<p>
There are numerous shaders and algorithms for doing &quot;tone mapping&quot; 
(this is a very active area of research within the CG industry), and 
the architectural library provides two: One very simple shader that 
simply adds a knee compression to &quot;squash&quot; over-brights into a 
manageable range, and a more complex &quot;photographic&quot; version that
converts real photometric luminances with the help of parameters
found on a normal camera into an image.
<p>
These shaders can be applied either as a lens shaders (which will 
tone map the image &quot;on the fly&quot; as it is being rendered) or as 
output shaders (will tone map the image as a post process). 
<p>
Since both of these tone mappers affects each pixel individually<a href="#Foot1" title="Many advanced tone mappers weight different areas of the image against other areas, to mimic the way the human visual system operates. These tone mappers need the entire image before they can &quot;do their job&quot;."><sup>1</sup></a>
, the former method (as lens shader) is encouraged, since it applies 
on the sample level rather than the pixel level.
<p>
Also, both of the supplied tone mappers include a <em>gamma</em> 
term. It is important to know if one is already applying a 
gamma correction elsewhere in the imaging pipeline (in an image
viewer, in compositing, etc.), and if so, set it to 1.0 in these
shaders. If one is <em>not</em> applying gamma correction anywhere
but simply displaying the image directly on screen with a viewer
that does not apply it's own gamma, one should most likely use
the gamma in these shaders, set to a value between 1.8 and 2.4.

<p>
The operation of this tone mapper is very simple. It does not
refer to real physical luminance values in any way. 
It simply takes the high dynamic range color and perform 
these operations in order:
<br />
<ul>

<li> <b>pedestal</b> is <em>added</em> to the color. 
<li> The color components are then multiplied with <b>gain</b>. 
<li> The resulting colors are checked if they are above the <b>knee</b> value.
<li> If they are, they are &quot;squashed&quot; by the compression ratio <b>compression</b>
<li> Finally, gamma correction with <b>gamma</b> is performed.
</ul>

<p>
That's the theory. What is the practical use of these parameters?
<p>
Changing <b>pedestal</b> equates to tweaking the &quot;black level&quot;. 
A positive value will add some light so even the blackest black will 
become slightly gray. 
A negative value will subtract some light and allows 
&quot;crushing the blacks&quot; for a more contrasty artistic effect.
<p>
<b>gain</b> is the &quot;brightness knob&quot;. 
This is the main point where the high dynamic range values are
converted to low dynamic range values. For example: if one knows 
the approximate range of color intensities goes between 0 and 10,
this value should then be approximately 0.1 to get this range
into the desired 0-1 range. 
<p>
However, the whole point of tone mapping is <em>not</em> to blindly
linearly scale the range down. Simply setting it to 0.1 most likely 
yields a dark and boring image. A much more likely value is 0.15 
or even 0.2. But a value of 0.2 will map our 0-to-10 range to
0 to 2.... what to do about that stuff above 1.0?
<p>
That's where the compression comes in. The <em>knee</em> level is
the point where the over-brights begin to be &quot;squashed&quot;. 
Since this is applied <em>after</em> the gain, it should be in
the range of 0.0 to 1.0. A good useful range is 0.5 to 0.75.
<p>
Assume we set it to 0.75. This means any color that (after
having <b>pedestal</b> added and multiplied by 
<b>gain</b>) that comes out above 0.75 will be 
&quot;compressed&quot;. If <b>compression</b> is 0.0 there is 
no compression. At a <b>compression</b> value of 5.0
the squashing is fairly strong.
<p>
Finally, the resulting &quot;squashed&quot; color is gamma-corrected
for the output device (computer screen etc.)
<p>
<a name="Use_Preview"></a>
The <b>use_preview</b> and <b>preview</b> parameters are used
to make the process of tweaking the tone mapper a little bit more 
&quot;interactive&quot;. 
<p>
The intended use is the following, for when the shader is applied
as a <em>lens shader</em>:
<br />
<ul>

<li> Disable the <i>mia_exposure_simple</i> shader.
<li> Render the image to a file in some form of HDR capable format (like
      .exr, .hdr or similar), for example <code>preview.exr</code>.
<li> Enable <i>mia_exposure_simple</i> shader again.
<li> Set the <b>preview</b> parameter to the file saved above, e.g. 
      <code>preview.exr</code>.
<li> Enable the <b>use_preview</b> parameter.
<li> Disable any photon mapping or final gathering.
<li> Re-render. The rendering will be near instant, because no actual
      rendering occurs at all; the image is read from <code>preview.exr</code>
      and immediately tone mapped to screen.
<li> Tweak parameters and re-render again, until satisfied.
<li> Re-enable any photons or final gathering. 
<li> Turn off <b>use_preview</b>.
<li> Voila - the tone mapper is now tuned.
</ul>

<p>
The photographic tonemapper converts actual pixel luminances
(in candela per square meter) into image pixels as seen
by a camera, applying camera-related parmeters (like f-stops
and shutter times) for the exposure, as well as applying
tonemapping that emulates film- and camera-like effects.
<p>
It has two basic modes:
<ul>

<li> &quot;Photographic&quot; - in which it assumes input values are 
        (or can be converted to) candela per square meter.
<li> &quot;Arbitrary&quot; - in which scene pixels are not considered to be
        in any particular physical unit, but are simply scaled by
        a factor to fit in the display range of the screen.
</ul>

<p>
If the <b>film_iso</b> parameter is nonzero, the &quot;`Photographic&quot;
mode is used, and if it is zero, the &quot;Arbitrary&quot; mode is chosen.
<p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>
In &quot;Photographic mode&quot; (nonzero <b>film_iso</b>) <b>cm2_factor</b> is 
the conversion factor between pixel values and candela per square meter. 
This is discussed more in detail below. 
<p>
In &quot;Arbitrary&quot; mode, <b>cm2_factor</b> is simply the multiplier applied 
to scale rendered pixel values to screen pixels. This is analogous to the 
<em>gain</em> parameter of <i>mia_exposure_simple</i>.
<p>
<b>whitepoint</b> is a color that will be mapped to &quot;white&quot; 
on output, i.e. an incoming color of this hue/saturation will be
mapped to grayscale, but its intensity will remain unchanged.
<p>
<b>film_iso</b> should be the ISO number of the film, also known as
&quot;film speed&quot;. As mentioned above, if this is zero, the &quot;Arbitrary&quot;
mode is enabled, and all color scaling is then strictly defined by 
the value of <b>cm2_factor</b>.
<p>
<b>camera_shutter</b> is the camera shutter time expressed as fractional
seconds, i.e. the value 100 means a camera shutter of 1/100. This value has
no effect in &quot;Arbitrary&quot; mode.
<p>
<a name="f_stops"></a>
<b>f_number</b> is the fractional aperture number, i.e. 11 means aperture
&quot;f/11&quot;. Aperture numbers on cameras go in specific standard series, i.e.
&quot;f/8&quot;, &quot;f/11&quot;, &quot;f/16&quot;, &quot;f/22&quot; etc. Each of these are refered
to as a &quot;stop&quot; (from the fact that aperture rings on real lenses tend to 
have physical &quot;clicks&quot; for these values) and each such &quot;stop&quot; 
represents halving the amount of light hitting the film per increased 
stop<a href="#Foot2" title="Sometimes the f-number can be found labeled &quot;f-stop&quot;. Since this is ambiguous, we have chosen the term f-number for clarity."><sup>2</sup></a>.
It is important to note that this shader doesn't count &quot;stops&quot;, but 
actually wants the f-number <em>for</em> that stop. This value has no effect 
in &quot;Arbitrary&quot; mode.
<p>
In a real camera the angle with which the light hits the film impacts
the exposure, causing the image to go darker around the edges. The 
<b>vignetting</b> parameter simulates this. When 0.0, it is off, 
and higher values cause stronger and stronger darkening around the
edges. Note that this effect is based on the cosine of the angle
with which the light ray would hit the film plane, and is hence
affected by the field-of-view of the camera, and will not work at all
for orthographic renderings. A good default is 3.0, which is similar
to what a compact camera would generate<a href="#Foot3" title="Technically, the pixel intensity is multiplied by the cosine of the angle of the ray to the film plane raised to the power of the vignetting parameter."><sup>3</sup></a>.
<p>
The parameters <b>burn_highlights</b> and <b>crush_blacks</b> 
guide the actual &quot;tone mapping&quot; of the image, i.e. exactly <em>how</em> 
the high dynamic range imagery is adapted to fit into the black-to-white
range of a display device.
<p>
If <b>burn_highlights</b> is 1 and <b>crush_blacks</b> is zero,
the transfer is linear, i.e. the shader behaves like a simple linear
intensity scaler only.
<p>
<b>burn_highlights</b> can be considered the parameter defining
how much &quot;over exposure&quot; is allowed. As it is decreased from 1
towards 0, high intensities will be more and more &quot;compressed&quot; to
lower intensities. When it is 0, the compression curve is asymptotic,
i.e. an <em>infinite</em> input value maps to <em>white</em> output value,
i.e. over-exposure is no longer possible. A good default value is 0.5.
<p>
When the upper part of the dynamic range becomes compressed it naturally
loses some of it's former contrast, and one often desire to regain some 
&quot;punch&quot; in the image by using the <b>crush_blacks</b> parameter. 
When 0, the lower intensity range is linear, but when raised towards 1, 
a strong &quot;toe&quot; region is added to the transfer curve so that low 
intensities gets pushed more towards black, but in a gentle (soft) fashion.
<p>
Compressing bright color components inherently moves them towards a 
less saturated color. Sometimes, very strong compressions can make
the image in an unappealingly de-saturated state. The <b>saturation</b>
parameter allows an artistic control over the final image saturation.
1.0 is the standard &quot;unmodified&quot; saturation, higher increases and
lower decreases saturation.
<p>
The <b>gamma</b> parameter applies a display gamma correction. 
Be careful not to apply gamma twice in the image pipeline. 
This is discussed in more detail on page <a href="arch_mtl.html#Gamma">Gamma</a>.
<p>
The <b>side_channel</b> and <b>side_channel_mode</b> is intended
for OEM integrations of the shader, to support &quot;interactive&quot; tweaking  
as well as for the case where one wants to insert an output shader prior 
to the conversion to &quot;display pixel values&quot;. 
<p>
This is accomplished by applying two copies of the
shader, one as lens shader, the other as output shader. The two shaders
communicate via the &quot;side channel&quot;, which is a separate floating
point frame buffer that needs to be set up prior to rendering.
<p>
Valid values for <b>side_channel_mode</b> are:
<br />
<ul>

<li> 0 - the shader is run normally as either lens- or output-shader.
<li> 1 - the lens shader will save the un-tonemapped value in the
          <b>side_channel</b> frame buffer. The
          output shader will re-execute the tone mapping based on
          the data in the side channel, <em>not</em> the pixels
          in the main frame buffer.
<li> 2 - the lens shader works as for option 1, the output shader
          will read the pixels from the <b>side_channel</b> frame
          buffer back into the main frame buffer. This is useful when
          one want to run third party output shaders on it that
          only support working on the main frame buffer. 
</ul>

<p>
One may wonder, if one wants to apply the tone mapping as a post process,
why not skip applying the lens shader completely? The answer is twofold: First,
by applying the lens shader (even though it's output is never used), one can
<em>see</em> something while rendering, which is always helpful. Second, 
the mental ray <em>over-sampling</em> is guided by the pixels in the main frame buffer.
If these are left in full dynamic range, mental ray may needlessly shoot 
thousands of extra samples in areas of &quot;high contrast&quot; that will all be tone 
mapped down to white in the final
stage.
<p>
The <b>use_preview</b> and <b>preview</b> work exactly like 
in the <i>mia_exposure_simple</i> shader described above.
<p>
<h4 id="Examples">Examples</h4>
<p>
Lets walk through a practical example of tuning the photographic tone 
mapper. We have a scene showing both an indoor and outdoor area, 
using the sun and sky, <i>mia_material</i>, and a 
portal light in the window. The units are set up such that the
raw pixels are in candela per square meter.
<p>
The raw render, with no tone mapping, looks something like this:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/toneop-notoneop.jpg" alt="No tone mapping"><br />No tone mapping
</div>
<p>
This is the typical look of a Gamma=1 un-tonemapped image. Bright
areas blow out in a very unpleasing way, shadows are unrealistically
harsh and dark, and the colors are extremely over-saturated.
<p>
Applying <i>mia_exposure_photographic</i> with the following settings:
<p>
<pre>
    "cm2_factor"         1.0,
    "whitepoint"         1 1 1,
    "film_iso"           100,
    "camera_shutter"     100.0,
    "f_number"           16.0,
    "vignetting"         0.0,
    "burn_highlights"    1.0,
    "crush_blacks"       0.0,
    "saturation"         1.0,
    "gamma"              2.2,
</pre>
<p>
...gives the following image as a result<a href="#Foot4" title="For speedy results in trying out settings for the tone mapping shaders, try the workflow with the &quot;preview&quot; parameter described on page Use Preview."><sup>4</sup></a>:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/toneop-sunny-16.jpg" alt="The &quot;Sunny 16&quot; result"><br />The &quot;Sunny 16&quot; result
</div>
<p>
The settings we used abide by the &quot;Sunny 16&quot; rule in photography;
for an aperture of f/16, setting the shutter speed (in fractional seconds) 
equal to the film speed (as an ISO number) generates a &quot;good&quot; exposure
for an outdoor sunny scene. As we can see, indeed, the outdoor area
looks fine, but the indoor area is clearly underexposed.
<p>
In photography, the &quot;film speed&quot; (the ISO value), the aperture (f_number)
and shutter time all interact to define the actual exposure of the camera. 
Hence, to modify the exposure you could modify either for the &quot;same&quot; result.
For example, to make the image half as bright, we could halve the shutter time,
halve the ISO of our film, or change the aperture one &quot;stop&quot; (for example from 
f/16 to f/22, see page <a href="arch_camera.html#f_stops">f-stops</a> for more details).
<p>
In a real world camera there would be subtle differences between these
different methods, but with this shader they are mathematically equivalent.
<div class="pic">
<img width="80%" src="images/toneop-fstop-8.jpg" alt="f/8"><br />f/8<br /><img width="80%" src="images/toneop-fstop-4.jpg" alt="f/4"><br />f/4<br /></div>
<p>
Clearly the f/4 image is the best choice for the indoor part, but now the 
outdoor area is extremely overexposed. 
This is because we have the <b>burn_highlights</b> parameter at 1.0, which does not 
perform <em>any</em> compression of highlights.
<div class="pic">
<img width="80%" src="images/toneop-burn-05.jpg" alt="<b>burn_highlights</b> = 0.5"><br /><b>burn_highlights</b> = 0.5<br /><img width="80%" src="images/toneop-burn-0.jpg" alt="<b>burn_highlights</b> = 0.0"><br /><b>burn_highlights</b> = 0.0<br /></div>
<p>
The left image subdues the overexposure some. The right image is
using a <b>burn_highlights</b> of zero, which actually removes <em>any</em> over-
exposure completely. However, this has the drawback of killing
most contrast in the image, and while real film indeed performs
a compression of the over-brights, no film exists that magically
removes <em>all</em> overexposure. Hence, it is suggested to keep 
<b>burn_highlights</b> small, yet non-zero. In our example we pick the 0.5 value.
<p>
Real cameras have a falloff near the edges of the image known as 
&quot;vignetting&quot;, which is supported in this shader by using the 
parameter of the same name:
<div class="pic">
<img width="80%" src="images/toneop-vign-5.jpg" alt="<b>vignetting</b> = 5"><br /><b>vignetting</b> = 5<br /><img width="80%" src="images/toneop-vign-11.jpg" alt="<b>vignetting</b> = 11"><br /><b>vignetting</b> = 11<br /></div>
<p>
The image on the right is interesting in that it &quot;helps&quot; our
overexposed outdoors by the fact that it happens to be on the
edge of the image and is hence attenuated by the vignetting.
However, the left edge turns out too dark.
<p>
We will try a middle-of-the road version using a 
<b>vignetting</b> of 6 and we modify the <b>burn_highlights</b> to 0.25 and get 
this image:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/toneop-vign-6-burn-025.jpg" alt="<b>vignetting</b> = 6 <b>burn_highlights</b> = 0.25"><br /><b>vignetting</b> = 6 <b>burn_highlights</b> = 0.25
</div>
<p>
This image is nice, but it really lacks that feel of &quot;contrast&quot;. To
help this we play with the <b>crush_shadows</b> parameter:
<div class="pic">
<img width="80%" src="images/toneop-crush-02.jpg" alt="<b>crush_shadows</b> = 0.2"><br /><b>crush_shadows</b> = 0.2<br /><img width="80%" src="images/toneop-crush-06.jpg" alt="<b>crush_shadows</b> = 0.6"><br /><b>crush_shadows</b> = 0.6<br /></div>
<p>
The <b>crush_shadows</b> parameter deepens the lower end of the intensity curve, and
we get some very nice contrast. However, since this image is already 
near the &quot;too dark&quot; end of the spectrum, it tends to show an effect 
of darkening the entire image a bit. 
<p>
This can be compensated by changing the exposure. Lets try a couple of 
different <b>shutter</b> values, and prevent overexposure by further 
lowering our <b>burn_highlights</b> value:
<div class="pic">
<img width="80%" src="images/toneop-shutter-50-burn-01.jpg" alt="<b>shutter</b> = 50, <b>burn_highlights</b> = 0.1"><br /><b>shutter</b> = 50, <b>burn_highlights</b> = 0.1<br /><img width="80%" src="images/toneop-shutter-30.jpg" alt="<b>shutter</b> = 30, <b>burn_highlights</b> = 0.1"><br /><b>shutter</b> = 30, <b>burn_highlights</b> = 0.1<br /></div>
<p>
The final image is pretty good. However, since so much highlight compression 
is going on, we have lost a lot of color saturation by now. Lets try to finalize 
this by compensating:
<div class="pic">
<img width="80%" src="images/toneop-shutter-30.jpg" alt="<b>saturation</b> = 1.0"><br /><b>saturation</b> = 1.0<br /><img width="80%" src="images/toneop-satu-14.jpg" alt="<b>saturation</b> = 1.4"><br /><b>saturation</b> = 1.4<br /></div>
<p>
Now we have some color back, the image is fairly well balanced. We still see 
something exists outdoors. This is probably the best we can do that is still
<em>physically correct</em>.
<p>
However, remember we were using the portal lights for the window? These have a
non-physical &quot;transparency&quot; mode. This mode is intended to solve exactly this
issue. Even though the result we have so far is &quot;correct&quot;, many people 
intuitively expect to see the outdoor scene much more clearly. Since our
eyes does such a magnificent job at compensating for the huge dynamic range
difference between the sunlit outdoors and the much darker indoors, we
expect our computers to magically do the same. Using the transparency feature
of the portal lights, this can be achieved visually, without actually changing
the <em>actual</em> intensities of any light going into the room:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/toneop-portal-05.jpg" alt="A <b>transparency</b> of 0.5 in the portal light"><br />A <b>transparency</b> of 0.5 in the portal light
</div>
<p>
Now the objects outdoors are visible, while maintaining the contrast indoors.
The light level indoors hasn't changed and still follows the real world values 
(unlike if we had put actual dark glass into the window, which would have
attenuated the incoming light as well).
<p>
Now this is a mid day scene. What if we change the time of day and put the
sun lower on the horizon? The scene will be much darker, and we can
compensate by changing the exposure:
<div class="pic">
<img width="80%" src="images/toneop-night.jpg" alt="7 PM"><br />7 PM<br /><img width="80%" src="images/toneop-night-shutter-2.jpg" alt="With shutter 1/2 second"><br />With shutter 1/2 second<br /></div>
<p>
Keeping the same settings (left) with the new sun angle makes a very dark
image. On the right, all we changed was the shutter time to 2 (half a second).
This image has a bit of a yellow cast due to the reddish sunlight, as well
as the yellowish incandescent lighting. To compensate, we set the white-point
to a yellowish color:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/toneop-night-whitepoint.jpg" alt="Evening shot with adjusted white-point"><br />Evening shot with adjusted white-point
</div>
<p>
The remaining issue is the overexposure around the lamp (although it would be there
in a real photograph), so we make the final image with <b>burn_highlights</b> set to a very low value,
yet keep it nonzero to maintain a little bit of &quot;punch&quot;:
<div class="pic">
<img width="100%" src="images/toneop-night-burn-001.jpg" alt="<b>burn_highlights</b> = 0.01"><br /><b>burn_highlights</b> = 0.01
</div>
<p>
In conclusion: Photography-related parameters help users with 
experience in photography make good judgements on suitable values. 
The intuitive &quot;look&quot; parameters allow further adjustment of the 
image for a visually pleasing result.

&quot;Bokeh&quot; is a Japanese term meaning &quot;blur&quot;, that is often used
to refer to the perceived &quot;look&quot; of out-of-focus regions in a
photograph. The term &quot;Depth of Field&quot; (henceforth abbreviated DOF) 
does in actuality not describe the blur itself, but the &quot;depth&quot; of 
the region that <em>is in focus</em>. However, it is common parlance 
to talk about &quot;DOF&quot; while refering to the blur itself.
<p>
This shader is very similar to the <b>physical_lens_dof</b> in the
physics library, but with more control on the actual <em>appearance</em>
and quality of the blur.
<p>
<pre>
declare shader "mia_lens_bokeh" (
        boolean "on"          default on,
        scalar  "plane"       default 100.0,
        scalar  "radius"      default 1.0,
        integer "samples"     default 4,
        scalar  "bias"        default 1.0,
        integer "blade_count" default 0,
        scalar  "blade_angle" default 0,
        boolean "use_bokeh"   default off,
        color texture "bokeh"
    )
    version 4
    apply lens
    scanline off
end declare
</pre>
<p>
<b>on</b> enables the shader.
<p>
<b>plane</b> is the distance to the focal plane from the camera,
i.e. a point at this distance from the camera is completely in focus.

<p>
<b>radius</b> is the radius of confusion. This is an actual
measurement in scene units, and for a real-world camera this
is approximately the radius of the <em>iris</em>, i.e. it
depends on the cameras f-stop. But it is a good rule of
thumb to keep it on the order of a couple of centimeters in size
(expressed in the current scene units), otherwise the scene may come 
out unrealistic and be perceived as a 
minature<a href="#Foot5" title="The diameter of the iris is the focal length of the lens (in scene units) divided by the f-number. Since this parameter is a radius (not a diameter) it is half of that, i.e. (focal_length / f_number) / 2."><sup>5</sup></a>.

<p>
<b>samples</b> defines how many rays are shot. Fewer is faster but
grainier, more is slower but smoother:

<p>
When <b>bias</b> is 1.0, the circle of confusion is sampled as
a uniform disk. Lower values push the sample probability towards
the center, creating a &quot;softer&quot; looking DOF effect with a more
&quot;misty&quot; look. Higher values push the sample probability towards
the edge, creating a &quot;harder&quot; looking DOF where bright spots
actually resolve as small circles.
<div class="pic">
<img width="80%" src="images/dof-lobias.jpg" alt="bias = 0.5"><br />bias = 0.5<br /><img width="80%" src="images/dof-hibias.jpg" alt="bias = 2.0"><br />bias = 2.0<br /></div>
<p>
The <b>blade_count</b> defines how many &quot;edges&quot; the &quot;circle&quot;
of confusion has. A zero value makes it a perfect circle. One can
also set the angle with the <b>blade_angle</b> parameter, which
is expressed such that 0.0 is zero degrees and 1.0 is 360 degrees.
<div class="pic">
<img width="80%" src="images/dof-6blade.jpg" alt="blade_count=6, angle=0.0, bias=2.0"><br />blade_count=6, angle=0.0, bias=2.0<br /><img width="80%" src="images/dof-4blade.jpg" alt="blade_count=4, angle=0.1, bias=2.0"><br />blade_count=4, angle=0.1, bias=2.0<br /></div>
<p>
The <b>use_bokeh</b> parameter enables the user of a specific
<b>bokeh</b> map. When this parameter is used, the parameters
<b>bias</b>, <b>blade_count</b> and <b>blade_angle</b>
have no effect. The map defines the shape of the DOF filter
kernel, so a filled white circle on a black background is 
equivalent to the standard blur. Generally, one need more samples
to accurately &quot;resolve&quot; a custom bokeh map than the built-in
bokeh shape, which has an optimal sampling distribution.

With <b>bias</b> at 1.0, <b>samples</b> at 4, <b>blade_count</b>
at 0 and <b>use_bokeh</b> off, this shader renders an identical 
image to the old <b>physical_lens_dof</b> shader.

Many advanced tone mappers weight different areas of the image against
other areas, to mimic the way the human visual system operates. These
tone mappers need the entire image before they can &quot;do their job&quot;.

<dd>Sometimes the f-number can be found labeled &quot;f-stop&quot;. 
Since this is ambiguous, we have chosen the term f-number for clarity.

pixel intensity is multiplied by the cosine of the angle of the ray
to the film plane raised to the power of the <b>vignetting</b>
parameter.

<dd>The diameter of the iris is the focal length
of the lens (in scene units) divided by the f-number. 
Since this parameter is a radius (not a diameter) it is half of 
that, i.e. (focal_length / f_number) / 2.
