  <h2>Materials</h2>

  <p>The material shaders <i>dgs_material</i> and
  <i>dielectric_material</i> implement different physically based
  models of reflection and refraction.</p>

  <h3> Diffuse-glossy-specular Material</h3>

  <p>The <i>dgs_material</i> material shader can simulate mirrors,
  glossy paint or plastic, anisotropic glossy materials such as
  brushed metal, diffuse materials such as paper, translucent
  materials such as frosted glass, and any combination of these.
  This shader cannot be used as a shadow shader because shadows can
  only be computed along straight light rays, which does not agree
  with the definition of DGS materials. Use global illumination to
  illuminate objects in partial shadow from DGS objects.</p>

  <pre>
    color "dgs_material" (
        color           "diffuse",
        color           "glossy",
        color           "specular",
        scalar          "shiny",
        scalar          "shiny_u",
        scalar          "shiny_v",

        scalar          "ior",
        array light     "lights"
        integer         "mode")
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>diffuse<dd> is added to the result for each light, after
  multiplication with the color returned by the light and a weight
  based on the dot product of the incident light direction and the
  light direction.

  <dt>glossy<dd> provides the color of glossy highlights.

  <dt>specular<dd> provides the color of mirror reflections.

  <dt>shiny<dd> determines the width of the isotropic glossy
  reflection, in a manner similar to the Phong reflection exponent:
  5 is very wide and 100 is very narrow. If shiny is nonzero, the
  following five anisotropic parameters are ignored.

  <dt>shiny_u<br>shiny_v<dd> are used for anisotropic
  glossy reflection. The specify the width of the glossy reflection
  is in the first derivative U and V directions. (Derivatives must
  be enabled or specified on the polygons or free-form surfaces
  that this shader is applied to.) The regular shiny parameter must
  be undefined or set to 0.

  <dt>transp<dd> specifies transparency (if ior is 1) or
  refractivity (if ior is not 1). It also indirectly specifies
  reflectivity, as <i>1 - transp</i>. Specular transmission is the
  same as refraction, while glossy and diffuse transmission is
  known as translucency.

  <dt>ior<dd> is the index of refraction of the material. Metals
  typically have higher index of refraction than glass.

  <dt>lights<dd>is a list of light instances used for
  <a href="node8.html#lightlists">light lists</a>.

  <dt>mode<dd>controls which lights to use, see
  <a href="node8.html#lightlists">light lists</a>.
</dl>

  <p>For isotropic reflection, use the shiny parameter and leave
  the shiny_u and shiny_v parameters undefined. If the shiny
  parameter is undefined or zero, the shader will check whether
  shiny_u and shiny_v are defined and nonzero, and if so, compute
  anisotropic reflection. The surface U direction is used as the
  anisotropic brushing direction.</p>

  <h3>Dielectric Material</h3>

  <p>The <i>dielectric_material</i> shader is a physically based
  material shader which can be used to simulate dielectric media
  such as glass, water, and other liquids. The shader uses
  Fresnel's formulas for dielectric interfaces. This means that
  most light is transmitted through the surface for perpendicular
  incident directions while most light is reflected by the surface
  for grazing incident angles, simulating the behavior of real
  dielectric materials. The shader also uses Beer's law for
  absorption of light that passes through a medium. This means that
  the light is subject to an exponential falloff as it is
  transmitted between two surfaces with dielectric material.</p>

  <p>Two types of dielectric interfaces are supported:
  dielectric-air simulates the interface between a dielectric
  material and air, such as glass-air, and dielectric-dielectric
  simulates the interface between two dielectric materials, such as
  glass-water.</p>

  <p>Two achieve physically correct simulations it is important to
  use the correct surface interfaces. When modeling a glass of
  cognac three different interfaces are required: glass-air,
  glass-cognac, and cognac-air. The dielectric material uses the
  normals of the surface to distinguish the media on either side of
  the interface. For a dielectric-air interface the normals point
  into the air. For a dielectric-dielectric interface the normal
  point into a dielectric material which is "outside". To use the
  dielectric material the model normals must be oriented correctly
  unless the ignore_normals parameter is set to true. This shader
  cannot be used as a shadow shader.</p>

        color           "col",
        scalar          "ior",
        color           "col_out",
        scalar          "ior_out",
        boolean         "ignore_normals"
        scalar          "phong_coef",
        array lights    "lights",
        integer         "mode")
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>col<dd> is the "persistence" coefficient which
  corresponds to the fraction of light which is left after
  traversing one unit of material. Thus 0.9 means that 10% of the
  light is absorbed per unit length of the material. Lengths are
  measured in world coordinates.

  <dt>ior<dd> is the index of refraction of the dielectric material.

  <dt>col_out<dd> if specified, the material is a
  dielectric-dielectric interface and col_out is the persistence
  coefficient of the outside dielectric material.

  <dt>ior_out<dd> is used in combination with col_out to describe
  the outside dielectric material.

  <dt>ignore_normals<dd>: normally the decision whether a ray
  enters or leaves the object is based on the direction of the
  normal (towards or away from the incident ray). If the object is
  poorly modeled and the normals cannot be trusted, this flag can
  be set to make the dielectric material shader count the number of
  times the ray has entered and left the object before instead of
  relying on the normal direction.

  <dt>pcoef<dd> is a phong coefficient used to compute
  <i>normalized phong highlights</i> which again is used to
  generate a fake impression of an area light source. If this
  component is zero there will be no fake highlights and only the
  reflected rays can create highlight effects if they hit something
  bright.

  <dt>lights<dd>is a list of light instances used for
  <a href="node8.html#lightlists">light lists</a>.

  <dt>mode<dd>controls which lights to use, see
  <a href="node8.html#lightlists">light lists</a>.
</dl>

  <h3>Path Material</h3>

  <p>The <i>path_material</i> shader implements path raytracing.
  On contrary to the distributed raytracing, for each ray hit, at most
  one ray is reflected or refracted when path raytracing is used.
  With sufficiently large trace depth limits, most of the indirect
  illumination effects are computed correctly. However, the results
  are very noisy and an extremely high number of samples is required
  for obtaining high quality images.</p>
  
  <p>
  Note that finalgather and globillum settings have no effect
  on the surfaces with <i>path_material</i>: the diffuse indirect 
  illumination component
  is computed by reflecting at most one ray according to a
  Lambertian-distributed direction. 
  There is no <i>path_material_photon</i> shader.
  For rendering speedup, finalgather and photon emission
  should be disabled. Higher trace depth setting than in the
  scenes using photons may be required.
