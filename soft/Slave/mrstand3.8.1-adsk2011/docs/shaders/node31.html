  <h3>Front and Back Surfaces</h3>

  <p id="misss:frontback">The words
  "front" and "back" will be mentioned many times in this
  chapter. These shaders use specially formatted lightmaps to
  simulate scattering. The lightmaps are generated in image space,
  i.e. from the camera's point of view, and they store the diffuse
  irradiance and z-depth of the front and back side of the
  object.</p>

  <p>In this context, "front" is defined as the first surface
  from the camera's point of view (that is facing towards the
  camera) and "back" as the second surface from the cameras point
  of view (that is facing away from the camera).</p>

  <p>One can say the front surface is everything seen in the final
  rendering, and the back surface, the next surface behind it,
  which, if lit, could potentially scatter light through the
  object, to illuminate the front surface. In a practical sense,
  this means that front surface scattering is scattering seen
  directly, and back surface scattering is any light going through
  the object.</p>

  <p>This also means that these functions are direction dependent
  and only work when the final render viewing direction is near or
  similar to the camera viewing direction, and the view projection
  is standard perspective or orthogonal. Observe the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Avoid lens shaders that significantly modify the ray
    direction to create non-standard camera projections.</li>

    <li>A mirror reflection that reveals an unmapped area (like the
    back of the object) will contain no scattering</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Unlike the physical implementation, these shaders do not
  require photons, global illumination, caustics or even ray
  tracing to be enabled.</p>

  <p>If any "through" scattering is planned (i.e. light passing
  through the object from the back to the front) one must think
  volumetrically when creating the model. While avoiding holes is
  not a necessity, it is imperative to pay attention to extra
  interior surfaces, since these will block light. For example, a
  "T" shape built from ramming two stretched cubes together will
  look incorrect due to the extra interior surfaces. An object
  fully contained within another object will, however, appear as a
  true embedded opaque object and can be useful for things like
  bones inside fingers for the "hand over flashlight" effect. The
  contained object must be included in the lightmap to act as a
  light blocker - any other contained object is simply ignored. The
  easiest way to do this is to apply the same material to the
  contained object, since it will never actually be seen or shaded,
  just block light.</p>
