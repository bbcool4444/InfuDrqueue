  <h2>Environments</h2>

  <p>These shaders return colors from color textures that are
  mapped to finite or infinite distances. They are useful for
  adding background or foreground plates to the rendered scene.
  Environments must be used for environment shaders, overlays must
  be used for lens shaders, and textures must be used for texture
  or material shaders on a plane or other object in the scene.</p>

  <h3>Spherical Environment</h3>

  <p>Given a texture shader, assume that the texture it produces is
  wrapped on an infinite sphere around the scene, evaluate the
  texture, and return the color. This is useful for environment
  shaders.</p>

  <a id="INDEX8"></a>
<h5 class="anchor" id="mi_shader__mib_lookup_spherical">mib_lookup_spherical</h5>
  <pre>
    color "mib_lookup_spherical" (
        vector          "dir",
        scalar          "rotate",
        color texture   "tex")
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>dir<dd> is the direction to sample. If connected to
  <i>mib_texture_vector</i>, a select value of -10 is useful. It
  should be given in world space. If this is the null vector, the
  ray direction is used, after conversion to world space.</p>

  <dt>tex<dd> is a texture or shader to look up at the computed
  coordinate.</p>
</dl>

  <h3>Cube Environment</h3>

  <p>Same as the spherical environment shader, but accept either
  one or six textures mapped on an infinite cube. This is useful
  for environment shaders.</p>

  <a id="INDEX9"></a>
<h5 class="anchor" id="mi_shader__mib_lookup_cube1">mib_lookup_cube1</h5>
  <pre>
    color "mib_lookup_cube1" (
        vector          "point",
        vector          "dir",
        vector          "size",
        color texture   "tex")
</pre>
<h5 class="anchor" id="mi_shader__mib_lookup_cube6">mib_lookup_cube6</h5>
<pre>
    color "mib_lookup_cube6" (
        vector          "point",
        vector          "dir",
        vector          "size",
        color texture   "tex_mx",
        color texture   "tex_px",
        color texture   "tex_my",
        color texture   "tex_py",
        color texture   "tex_mz",
        color texture   "tex_pz")
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>point<dd> is the view location.</p>

  <dt>dir<dd> is the direction to sample. If connected to
  <i>mib_texture_vector</i>, a select value of -10 is useful. If
  this is the null vector, the ray direction is used.</p>

  <dt>size<dd> is the size of the box.</p>

  <dt>tex<dd> is a texture to look up at the computed coordinate.
  One texture contains all six sides; it has six times the number
  of scanlines required for a single face, with the sub-textures
  stacked in the following order, top-down: -x, +x, -y, +y, -z,
  +z.</p>

  <dt>tex_**<dd> are six textures for the left (mx), right (px),
  bottom (my), top (py), yon (mz), and hither (pz) faces. "p" and
  "m" stand for plus and minus.</p>
</dl>

  <h3>Cylindrical Environment</h3>

  <p>This environment shader is most useful for projecting regular
  patterns onto geometry, for example for surface quality control.
  The cylinder does not have caps, so it might happen that rays do
  not hit the cylinder. The cylinder is defined by a transformation
  which transforms from world to canonical cylinder space, and two
  scalars that allow cutting off part of the cylinder. If both
  <i>begin</i> and <i>end</i> are zero, a full cylinder is
  selected.</p>

  <a id="INDEX10"></a>
<h5 class="anchor" id="mi_shader__mib_lookup_cylindrical">mib_lookup_cylindrical</h5>
  <pre>
    color "mib_lookup_cylindrical" (
        transform       "xform",
        scalar          "begin",
        scalar          "end",
        color texture   "tex" )
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>xform<dd> transforms from world to canonical cylinder
  space. The canonical cylinder has the Z axis as the major axis,
  extends from <i>-1</i> to <i>+1</i> on the Z axis and has a
  radius of 1. If tex is a procedural texture, texture coordinates
  are calculated for the intersection point: <i>Z = -1</i> is
  mapped to <i>v = 0</i> and <i>Z = +1</i> is mapped to <i>v =
  1</i>. Texture coordinates for u are calculated counterclockwise
  around the Z axis where <i>+X</i> is mapped to <i>u = 0</i> and
  <i>-X</i> to 0.5.</p>

  <dt>begin<dd> specifies the starting angle in radians where the
  cylinder begins. The angle specification is based on <i>+X =
  0</i> radians.</p>

  <dt>end<dd> specifies the ending angle where the cylinder body
  should end.</p>

  <dt>tex<dd> is a texture or shader to look up at the computed
  coordinate.</p>
</dl>

  <h3>Backgrounds</h3>

  <p>Given a texture shader, place it in the background of the
  scene such that the edges of the texture line up with the edges
  of the rendered image. Factors can be applied to stretch and pan
  the texture, to allow for lenses that bend rays away from the
  center. The purpose of this environment is inserting background
  plates. Returns a color. This is useful in three different types
  of shaders:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Environment shaders can place the background plate at
    infinity.</li>

    <li>Lens shaders can place the plate in front of the entire
    scene by evaluating the background shader first and casting an
    eye ray only if the returned alpha is less than 1, and blending
    the results.</li>

    <li>Material shaders on an XY axis aligned plane in the scene
    insert the plate at the Z coordinate of the plane if they first
    evaluate the background shader, then cast a transparency ray
    only if the returned alpha is less than 1, and blend the
    results.</li>
  </ul>

  <a id="INDEX11"></a>
<h5 class="anchor" id="mi_shader__mib_lookup_background">mib_lookup_background</h5>
  <pre>
    color "mib_lookup_background" (
        vector          "zoom",
        vector          "pan",
        boolean         "torus_u",
        boolean         "torus_v",
        color texture   "tex")
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>zoom<dd> enlarges the texture image by a factor given by
  the X and Y components of the zoom vector. The Z component is not
  used. If a component is 0, it defaults to 1.</p>

  <dt>pan<dd> shifts the texture sideways by a fraction of the
  rendered image size. The Z component is unused. For example, if
  the X component is 0.1, the left 10% of the rendered image
  background remain blank.</p>

  <dt>torus_*<dd>if true, repeats the texture endlessly in the
  respective direction. If false, transparent black is returned
  outside the tex image.</p>

  <dt>tex<dd> is a texture or shader to look up at the computed
  coordinate. It will be sampled in the range <i>[0 ... 1)</i>
  only.</p>
