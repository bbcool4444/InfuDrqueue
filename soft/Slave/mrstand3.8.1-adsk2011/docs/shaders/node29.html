  <h1 id="misss:subsurf">Subsurface Scattering Shaders</h1>

  <p id="app:sss">Many real world materials do not
  reflect light at their surface, but scatter or absorb light
  internally. These optical properties, which are not adequately
  addressed by the commonly used illumination models in computer
  graphics, are called "subsurface scattering".

  <p>Subsurface scattering is an important element for rendering a
  variety of naturally occurring materials. Even tiny amounts of
  scattering enhance the apparent "softness" of the surface for
  many organic substances such as human skin.

  <p>There are two separate sets of shaders and Phenomena to
  implement subsurface scattering: <br>the
  <a href="node30.html">fast, non-physical</a> versions, and the
  <a href="node35.html">physically correct</a> one.

<p>
  The <a href="node30.html">fast, non-physical</a> shaders are optimized to
  efficiently render human skin and other shallow, near furface scattering.
  While they do support "through" scattering it is not truly volumetric and
  most suitable for translucency of relatively thin objects such as ears.
<p>
  The <a href="node35.html">physical shader</a> renders subsurface scattering
  in a physically correct way. It attempts to simulate reality by applying the
  same (but simplified) mechanisms which happen in the natural world. Its goal
  is to provide a complete simulation of scattering beyond the scope of the
  <a href="node30.html">fast, non-physical</a> shaders, especially when
  photon tracing is used: photons from the environment need to interact with
  objects performing subsurface scattering, as well as photons emitted from
  such objects need to interact with the surroundings. Another example is
  light scattering trough volumetric geometry, as in a fiber channel.</p>
<p>
  The <a href="node30.html">fast shader</a> is recommended for:</p>
  <ul>
<li>leaves, grass, plastic, wax, butter,
<li>human skin, such as backlit ears,
<li>when rendering speed is important,
<li>when memory is important,
<li>materials into which light does not penetrate deeply.
  </ul>
<p>
  The <a href="node35.html">physical shader</a> is recommended for:</p>
  <ul>
<li>jade, emerald, and other highly translucent minerals,
<li>milk, blood, ketchup, ivory soap,
<li>thick slabs of translucent materials,
<li>anything where light scatters deeply,
<li>when rendering accuracy is important,
<li>experienced users to set up scenes for global illumination.
</ul>

<p>Before any shader in the base shader library can be used, it must be loaded
into the mental ray rendering software. A .mi scene file may use the statements
</p>
<pre>
        link "subsurface.so"
        $include &lt;subsurface.mi&gt;
</pre>
<p>All shader and phenomena names in this package are prefixed with "misss",
for "mental images subsurface scattering".</p>
