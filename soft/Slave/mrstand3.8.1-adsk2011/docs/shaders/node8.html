  <h3>Hair</h3>

  <p>Perform illumination on hair geometry similar to Phong. Hair requires
  specialized shaders because they are not shading regular triangles but
  procedural flat-ribbon geometry. Note, that special shaders should be
  used in parameter connections which can deal with the differences in
  shading or texture mapping on hair geometry.</p>

  <h3 id="lightlists">Light Lists</h3>

<p>All illumination shaders above have a <em>mode</em> parameter and a
<em>lights</em> parameter to control the set of lights which is used for
illumination. Illumination is performed either using the light instances
given in the <em>lights</em> parameter, or the light list of the geometry
instance to be shaded. Using the light lists assigned to scene objects allows
to share a common shader even on objects with different light relations.
The lights are used according to the following possible values for the
<em>mode</em> parameter:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>0</dt>
    <dd>illumination using the <em>lights</em> parameter; if no lights are specified,
    then using the instance light list; if no instance light list is specified,
    then using all lights in the scene. This is the default.</dd>
    <dt>1</dt>
    <dd>illumination using the specified <em>lights</em> in inclusive mode, i.e., instances of groups
    of light instances are evaluated to all light instances in the group</dd>
    <dt>2</dt>
    <dd>illumination using the specified <em>lights</em> in exclusive modes, i.e., using
    all lights except the specified ones</dd>
    <dt>4</dt>
    <dd>illumination ignoring any specified <em>lights</em>, and using the instance light list.
    If no instance light list is specified then all light instances in the scene are used.
    </dd>
