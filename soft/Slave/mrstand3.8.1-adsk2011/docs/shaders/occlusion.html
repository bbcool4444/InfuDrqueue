<h2>Occlusion</h2>

<h3>Ambient Occlusion</h3>

<p>
  Occlusion is a fast and simple method to simulate the effects of
  global illumination. Occlusion is the extent to which the area
  above a point is covered by other geometry. This is achieved by
  tracing a number of probe rays inside the hemispherical area
  above the point and testing to what extent this region is
  blocked.

  <p>Typical use of this shader is <i>ambient occlusion</i>,
  where the shader is used to scale the contribution of ambient lighting
  (which in turn may come from a diffuse environment map shader). For this use
  the shader should be assigned to the <i>ambient</i> parameters of materials
  like <i><a href="node8.html#INDEX29">mib_illum_phong</a></i>.

  <p>Another use of occlusion is <i>reflective occlusion</i>, where
  the shader is used to scale the contribution from a reflection
  map. For this use, the shader is generally plugged into an
  environment or reflection shader slot of a material, and the
  actual environment map image is plugged into the <i>bright</i>
  parameter. An alternative is to allow the return value of the
  occlusion shader to modulate the strength attribute of a
  reflection map shader.

  <p>A third use is to create files for external compositing, where
  the occlusion shader is assigned as the primary material shader on
  every object in the scene. The output can be used to modulate other
  render passes to achieve proper compositing in post-production.</p>

  <p>The shader may also be used as a <em>light shader</em>. The light
  source must be an area light of the <em>user</em> type. This generates
  an "ambient" lightsource with built in occlusion.</p>

  <p>This shader only depends on base ray tracing features provided by
  mental ray, and does neither use nor benefit from advanced computations
  like final gathering or global illumination.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>samples<dd> is the number of probe rays that will be sent.
  More rays yield a smoother image. Occlusion mapping will never be
  as smooth as well-tuned final gathering or photons, but is
  computationally cheap.

  <dt>bright<dd> is the color used when no occluding objects are
  found.
  <dt>dark<dd> is the color used when total occlusion
  occurs. In most practical cases it is set to black. For partial
  occlusion, a gradual mix between the <var>bright</var> and
  <var>dark</var>colors is returned.

  <dt>spread<dd> defines how large an area of the hemisphere
  above the point is sampled. The value defines a cone around the
  sampling direction which is narrower for small values and wider
  for large values. It ranges from 0.0, for a cone that is a single
  direction, to 1.0 for a cone that covers the entire hemisphere.

  <dt>max_distance<dd> is the range within which geometry is
  probed. If it is zero, the entire scene is sampled. If it is a
  nonzero value, only objects within this distance will be
  considered (which makes sampling much faster) where objects
  outside this range do not occlude at all and objects that are
  closer occlude more strongly as the distance approaches zero.

  <dt>reflective<dd> if turned off sampling is performed in a cone
  area based around the surface normal. If <i>reflective</i> is on,
  the samples are instead distributed around the reflection
  direction. This generates <i>reflective occlusion</i> which can
  enhance the realism of reflection mapping greatly.

  <dt>output_mode<dd> defines what the returned color is: 0
  enables standard occlusion behaviour; 1 enables environment
  sampling. This changes the behavior of the shader slightly. As
  directions are probed for occlusion, the current environment is
  also sampled and weighted based on how occluded that particular
  direction is. In mode 1 the output of the function is the
  gathered weighted environment colors multiplied by the
  <var>bright</var> color, and as a convenience the <var>dark</var>
  color is added.
  <dd>
  Setting <i>output_mode</i> to 2 enables bent normals. The
  average unoccluded world space normal direction is calculated and
  returned encoded as a color where red is x, green is y and blue
  is z. Setting <i>output_mode</i> to 3 is the same as 2 but the
  normals are encoded in the camera coordinate space instead.

  <dt>occlusion_in_alpha<dd> if turned on, the scalar occlusion
  value is put in the returned colors alpha component, regardless
  of what <i>output_mode</i> is set to. The other color components
  remain as before.

  <dt>falloff<dd> only matters when <var>max_distance</var> is
  nonzero and defines the speed at which the occlusion is attenuated
  by distance. Technically, it is a power function applied to the 
  normalized distance from 0 to <var>max_distance</var>. The default value 
  of 1.0 is a linear falloff. Values below 1.0 makes the falloff more 
  rapid. Practically this means that for lower values occlusion is 
  stronger for short distances (in small corners and crevices) and 
  softer over larger distances.
  
  <dt>id_inclexcl<dd> defines an object instance label number to be
  included (or excluded) from being considered occluding by the shader.
  Set to 0 the parameter has no effect. A positive integer means that
  only object instances with a label that <em>matches</em> this number
  will cause occlusion. A negative reverses the condition and includes
  all object instances <em>except</em> those with a matching label.
  
  <dt>id_nonself<dd> works similar to <var>id_inclexcl</var> in that it is
  an object instance label determining which objects do not self-occlude.
  Set to 0 it has no effect. Set to a positive integer will
  prevent any object with that label from occluding other objects
  with the same label. This is useful for "matte" or "stand-in"
  objects that represents existing geometry in a photographic background
  since any inter-occlusion between such objects are already present in
  the background photo. Simple exclusion by <var>id_inclexcl</var> cannot be
  used in this case because occlusion cast by "stand-in" background
  geometry onto foreground geometry and vice versa is both desired -
  only background-to-background occlusion needs to be prohibited.

<h3>Fast Occlusion</h3>

<p>
  This shader is an alternative version to
  <i><a href="#mi_shader__mib_amb_occlusion">mib_amb_occlusion</a></i>
  with similar funcionality, but it is fully utilizing the ambient occlusion
  facilities built into mental ray. This offers optimal rendering performance
  and the possibility to benefit from the <em>ambient occlusion cache</em>,
  if enabled.
<p>
  Note, this shader can not be used as a light shader.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>samples<dd> is the number of probe rays that will be sent.
  More rays yield a smoother image. If the ambient occlusion cache is enabled,
  this attribute will be ignored: the number of points to use for cache
  interpolation is controlled by the <em>cache_points</em> attribute, see below.

  <dt>bright<dd> is the color used when no occluding objects are
  found and <b>dark</b> is the color used when total occlusion
  occurs. In most practical cases it is set to black. For partial
  occlusion, a gradual mix between the two colors is returned.

  <dt>spread<dd> defines how large an area of the hemisphere
  above the point is sampled. Unlike the
  <i><a href="occlusion.html#mi_shader__mib_amb_occlusion">mib_amb_occlusion</a></i>
  shader, this value is the cosine of the angle between the normal and the
  maximum direction. Its value ranges from 0.0 for a cone that covers the
  entire hemisphere to 1.0 for a cone that is a single direction.

  <dt>spread_exp<dd>is the exponent of the spreading angle. It controls how
  the rays shot from the sampling point concentrate around the normal.
  A higher value means more density around the normal. <br><em>Currently
  not supported by mental ray but provided for future extensions.</em>

  <dt>max_distance<dd> is the range within which geometry is
  probed. If it is zero, the entire scene is sampled. If it is a
  nonzero value, only objects within this distance will be
  considered (which makes sampling much faster) where objects
  outside this range do not occlude at all and objects that are
  closer occlude more strongly as the distance approaches zero.

  <dt>reflective<dd> if turned off sampling is performed in a cone
  area based around the surface normal. If <var>reflective</var> is on,
  the samples are instead distributed around the reflection
  direction. This generates <i>reflective occlusion</i> which can
  enhance the realism of reflection mapping greatly.

  <dt>output_mode<dd> defines what the returned color is: 0
  enables standard occlusion behaviour; 1 enables environment
  sampling. This changes the behavior of the shader slightly. As
  directions are probed for occlusion, the current environment is
  also sampled and weighted based on how occluded that particular
  direction is. In mode 1 the output of the function is the
  gathered weighted environment colors multiplied by the
  <var>bright</var> color, and as a convenience the <var>dark</var>
  color is added.
  <dd>
  Setting <var>output_mode</var> to 2 enables bent normals. The
  average unoccluded world space normal direction is calculated and
  returned encoded as a color where red is x, green is y and blue
  is z. Setting <var>output_mode</var> to 3 is the same as 2 but the
  normals are encoded in the camera coordinate space instead.

  <dt>occlusion_in_alpha<dd> if turned on, the scalar occlusion
  value is put in the returned colors alpha component, regardless
  of what <var>output_mode</var> is set to. The other color components
  remain as before.

  <dt>cache_points<dd> is used to control the number of ambient occlusion points
  to lookup for interpolation in the ambient occlusion cache. If the latter is
  not enabled this attribute will be ignored. A value of 0 means the number
  of ambient occlusion points will be determined by mental ray settings, any
  value greater then 0 will override the setting for the current object.
  Values smaller than 64 give more precise results but artifacts can appear.
  Higher values tend to produce a blurry image.
</dl>

<h3>Ambient Occlusion using Final Gathering</h3>

  <p>The mental ray final gathering algorithm always computes a scalar
  occlusion value. This utitily shader simply returns this value as a
  grayscale result.</p>

<h5 class="anchor" id="mi_shader__mib_fg_occlusion">mib_fg_occlusion</h5>
<pre>
      color "mib_fg_occlusion" (
	  color "result_when_fg_is_off" default 1 1 1 1
      )
      version 1
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>result_when_fg_is_off<dd> becomes the return value when final gathering
  is off. When final gathering is on, the occlusion value is returned as a
  grayscale value, and the parameter is never evaluated at all or used in any way. 
  <dd>
  Hence, connecting <i><a href="#mi_shader__mib_amb_occlusion">mib_amb_occlusion</a></i>
  to the <var>result_when_fg_is_off</var> parameter, the result will be occlusion
  calculated by final gathering when it is on, and occlusion calculated by 
  <i><a href="#mi_shader__mib_amb_occlusion">mib_amb_occlusion</a></i> when
  final gathering is off.
</dl>

<h3>Bent Normals</h3>
  
  <p>"Bent normal" is a term used for the average
  un-occluded direction vector from a surface point. For completely
  un-occluded surfaces this is the same as the normal vector, but for
  surfaces occluded by other geometry it points in the direction in which
  the least amount of occluding geometry is found. Bent normals are used
  as an acceleration technique for ambient occlusion, allowing very
  fast rendering that look like global illumination or
  final gathering lit by an environment at a small fraction of the
  rendering time.
  
  <p>Ambient occlusion as done by the
  <i><a href="#mi_shader__mib_amb_occlusion">mib_amb_occlusion</a></i> shader
  is a ray tracing technique that casts potentially large numbers of probe rays
  to determine to which extent a surface point is occluded. The speed of this
  operation depends on the number of rays (<var>samples</var>), the reach of
  the rays (<var>max_distance</var>) and the complexity of the scene.

  <p>When rendering an animation (or multiple views of the same scene), 
  any object that does not move, does not change shape, or has no moving 
  occluding object nearby will yield the same result for every frame.
  Therefore one can "bake" (render to a file) the ambient occlusion 
  solution <em>once</em> in a first rendering pass, and re-use this result 
  in subsequent rendering passes for any number of frames, with potentially 
  huge performance gains. If one also "bakes" the average un-occluded
  direction (the bent normal) to a texture, the entire process of lighting
  the object based on an environment is moved to this second rendering pass,
  without having to trace a single ray.

  <p>By setting the <var>output_mode</var> parameter to 2, 3, or 4 on the
  ambient occlusion shader
  <i><a href="#mi_shader__mib_amb_occlusion">mib_amb_occlusion</a></i>,
  bent normals are returned with the vector being encoded as a color where
  x is red, y is green, and z is blue. If <var>occlusion_in_alpha</var> is
  enabled, the scalar occlusion value is returned in the alpha channel.
  This color can be baked into a texture, for example with the help of
  <i><a href="node15.html#mi_shader__mib_lightmap_write">mib_lightmap_write</a></i>
  by connecting <i><a href="#mi_shader__mib_amb_occlusion">mib_amb_occlusion</a></i>
  to its <var>input</var> parameter and rendering.

  <p>Once the texture file is generated,
  <i><a href="#mi_shader__mib_bent_normal_env">mib_bent_normal_env</a></i>
  can be assigned to a surface shader (for example to the <var>ambient</var>
  parameter of
  <i><a href="node8.html#mi_shader__mib_illum_phong">mib_illum_phong</a></i>
  to look up an environment to light the object based on the baked bent normal
  texture, which is placed in the <var>bent_normals</var> parameter of
  <i><a href="#mi_shader__mib_bent_normal_env">mib_bent_normal_env</a></i>.

  <p>This allows an extremely low-overhead simulation of global
  illumination-like effects for rigid objects and is especially suitable
  for animations. The technique does not work on deformable objects since
  their occlusion, shape, and normals can vary from frame to frame. For
  deformable objects, it is better to apply the occlusion shader directly,
  without baking its output.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>bent_normals<dd> is the bent normal data output by the occlusion 
  shader. It should be baked to the object. This is usually attached
  to a node that does the texture lookup such as
  <i><a href="node6.html#mi_shader__mib_texture_lookup">mib_texture_lookup</a></i>.
  The texture mapping used for generating the texture must match with
  the one used for lookup.
  
  <dt>occlusion_in_alpha<dd> specifies whether the scalar occlusion value
  is already baked into the alpha channel of the "bent normals" pass.
  This uses slightly less memory but many "bake to texture" functions
  of OEM integrations of mental ray do not bake the alpha channel.
  
  <dt>occlusion<dd> is the separate occlusion channel, to be used if it was 
  not already baked into the alpha channel.
  
  <dt>strength<dd> is a simple scalar multiplier for the effect.
  
  <dt>environment<dd> is the environment shader to look up. If none is
  provided, the environment from the material is used. To avoid image
  noise, it is often desirable to use a separate, highly blurred
  environment map with no high-resolution detail.

  <dt>coordinate_space<dd> defines the coordinate space of the bent normal:

  <ul>
  <li> 0 is "unmodified". The bent normal data is in internal space.
  <li> 1 is "by matrix". The bent normal data is transformed with the 
  	passed transformation matrix.
  <li> 2 is world space.
  <li> 3 is camera space. 
  <li> 4 is object space. This is often the most useful mode. If the
  	map is both created and used in object space, it will automatically
  	follow the object as it moves through an animation.
  </ul>

  <dd>The coordinate space numbers match the output_mode parameter values 
  of the ambient occlusion shader, where 2 is world space, 3 is camera
  space, and 4 is object space.

  <dt>env_samples<dd> is the number of samples to take from the environment
  map.  Normally, a highly-blurred environment map is used where only one
  sample is sufficient, but it is possible to multi-sample the environment
  map by setting a non-zero value.

  <dt>sample_spread<dd> is the spread factor for each individual environment
  sample.  The range is from 0.0 (infinitely thin rays -- a single sample)
  to 1.0 (the entire hemisphere is sampled).

  <dt>matrix<dd> is an explicit transformation matrix applied to the normal
  data when coordinate_space is 1. This allows arbitrary transformations.
