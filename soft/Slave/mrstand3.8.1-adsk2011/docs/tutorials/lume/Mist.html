The <FONT FACE=Helvetica>Mist</FONT> shader can create both a true layered fog,
along with a realistic depth fading effect. In addition, it allows for
increased control by providing the ability to specify directional variation with a texture map.<p>
Perhaps <FONT FACE=Helvetica>Mist</FONT>'s most interesting application is on
containers; applying <FONT FACE=Helvetica>Mist</FONT> as a volume shader of a
transparent object gives the object a murky interior, without adversely
effecting rendering times.<p>

<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B><BR><font size=+1>Parameters</font></B></FONT><p>
<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B>Overall</B></FONT><p>
<b>Transparency</b> controls the fog's maximum transparency. The fog will never
become more opaque than this value. Low values give a more opaque fog, higher
values give a more transparent fog.<p>
<b>Affect Alpha</b> controls whether or not <FONT
FACE=Helvetica>Mist</FONT><i> </i>applies itself to the alpha channel. With
Affect Alpha turned off, <FONT FACE=Helvetica>Mist</FONT> will not
alter the alpha-channel value.<p>
<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B>Color</B></FONT><p>
The artist has two ways of setting the fog's color. With <b>Use Solid Color</b> the
artist chooses one <b>Solid Color</b> that is applied in all directions, while <b>Use Map</b>
and <b>Bitmap</b> changes the color depending on viewing direction, much like a
reflection map, useful in situations such as a sunset, where the fog color is
different when looking toward or away from the sun.<p>
<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B>Layering</B></FONT><p>
To get the appearance of fog laying on a surface, <b>Layering</b> changes the fog's
thickness as a function of height. <b>Base Plane Normal</b> and <b>Base Plane Distance</b> 
control the layer's vertical direction and position from the world center.
<b>Transition Height</b> controls how tall the transitional layer is, and thus how
abruptly the fog varies from opaque to transparent.<p>

<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B>Falloff</B></FONT><p>
The Falloff settings control the rate at which the fog becomes opaque over
distance. <p>
<b>Linear Falloff</b> activates linear decay. At the <b>Linear Start</b>
distance the fog is transparent, and the <b>Linear End</b> distance the fog is opaque.
Distances between interpolate linearly.<p>

<b>Realistic Falloff</b> uses an exponential function, similar to a true natural fog.
Where the Linear falloff has an abrupt end (as an object passes through the End
distance, it almost seems to spring into view) the Realistic falloff is more
gradual. With Realistic, the artist has no direct control over starting and
ending distances, only the fog's overall thickness, controlled with
<b>Density</b>.<p>

<b>Custom Falloff</b> allows the artist to specify exactly what he wants as the falloff
curve. At the <b>Custom Start</b> distance the fog is transparent, and at the
<b>Custom End</b> distance the fog is opaque. At the <b>Custom Middle</b> distance the fog is
exactly halfway between transparent and opaque. Distances between are
interpolated on a spline curve. (See the discussion on <A HREF="Custom-Curves.html">Custom Curves</A>.)<p>
NOTE: If banding occurs when using <FONT FACE=Helvetica>Mist</FONT>, simply
turn on "Dithering" in the Render dialogue box to correct it.<p>
