Wet objects have a significantly different appearance than dry objects: some
have more saturated colors, others acquire a specular highlight. The <FONT
FACE=Helvetica>Wet</FONT><i> </i>shader facilitates the creation of this effect
by swapping textures for surfaces that are "wet". <p>

<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B></B></FONT>"Wetness" is specified by either the <FONT
FACE=Helvetica><A HREF="WaterSurface.html">WaterSurface</A></FONT> or 
<FONT FACE=Helvetica><A HREF="Stain.html">Stain</A></FONT>
shaders; when an object is seen through the
surface of an object which has either <FONT FACE=Helvetica>WaterSurface</FONT> or
<FONT FACE=Helvetica>Stain</FONT> applied, the wet object will display
its <b>Wet</b> color, otherwise the <b>Dry</b> color is used. (In the case of <FONT FACE=Helvetica>WaterSurface</FONT>,
the 'Stain Underneath' effect must be selected.) <p>
Note that if the camera enters the water, the textures must be reassigned, as
objects that are underwater will no longer be seen through the surface of the
water - since the camera itself is now underwater as well. In this case, the
dry-looking texture must now be placed on top of the wet-looking texture; also,
the <FONT FACE=Helvetica>Wet</FONT> shader would be removed from the
wet-looking texture and applied to the dry-looking one instead, since this is
the texture that the submerged camera would be seeing through the surface of
the water. (See the LumeWater tutorial for an example of this procedure.) <p>
