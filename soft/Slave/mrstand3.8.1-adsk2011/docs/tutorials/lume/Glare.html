Bright lighting in CG images is often difficult to accomplish. Many times
bright areas appear as solid white splotches with unrealistically hard edges.
<FONT FACE=Helvetica>Glare</FONT> comes to the rescue in these situations by
giving a halo around extra bright areas.<p>

<p>
In particular, <FONT FACE=Helvetica>Glare</FONT> is extremely helpful when an
image has areas of "over-exposure." Over-exposure occurs when color values move
beyond the solid white value of 1. While the color white (R:1.0, G:1.0, B:1.0)
may look the same as the color extra-bright-white (R:2.0, G:2.0, B:2.0), <FONT
FACE=Helvetica>Glare</FONT> treats them differently, giving larger halos to
brighter objects.<p>
It should be noted that <FONT FACE=Helvetica>Glare</FONT> gives realistic
glares and flares from any bright source - not just lights. For example, it
will create glares off of shiny metals, flares from reflections on a water
surface or glass object, etc. <p>

<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B></B></FONT><FONT FACE=Helvetica>Glare</FONT> can begin
to slow down rendering times when the scene has large bright areas.
<b>Quality</b> lets the artist set the tradeoff between detail and speed. Lower
Quality settings will cause <FONT FACE=Helvetica>Glare</FONT> to run more
quickly, but may cause the glare halo to be "boxy," whereas Higher Quality will
give a better overall effect, but will of course take longer. Generally, a
mid-level setting is appropriate for most scenes.<p>
<b>Spread</b> controls how sensitive <FONT FACE=Helvetica>Glare</FONT> is to
bright objects. Lower values for Spread will cause smaller glare halos while
higher values will cause larger glare halos. Very high values will cause dark
objects to have halos. (Try not to abuse the Spread parameter. The best way to
increase an object's halo is to increase its brightness, not to increase the
Spread.)<p>
<b>Overlay Only</b> mode will cause <FONT FACE=Helvetica>Glare</FONT> to
produce a glare "overlay". The overlay is an image of the glare effect only;
the original underlying image is removed. This mode is useful when render speed
is critical, so that <FONT FACE=Helvetica>Glare</FONT> can be run on a lower
resolution image to produce an overlay, which can then be composited with a
higher resolution underlying image.<p>
<b>Verbose</b> turns on verbose output, so that the progress of <FONT
FACE=Helvetica>Glare</FONT> can be monitored.<p>
<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B>Streaks</B></FONT><p>
When active, the Streaks feature allows you to specify an image file that will be
used to create a streaking effect, as seen when looking at bright images
through glass or, in photographs, through a camera lens.<p>
<b>Streak Image</b> is the streak template that <FONT FACE=Helvetica>Glare</FONT> uses
to draw streaks. Two example images are provided: "Glare-Eye" models the
streaks caused by the human eye, and "Glare-Star" models the streaks cause by a
star-filter camera lens.<p>

<p>
<b>Scale</b> controls how big the streaks image should be. A value of 1 means
that one pixel in the streaks image should cover one pixel in the output image.
Smaller values will make the streaks image smaller, larger values make the
streaks image larger.<p>
<b>Contrast</b> controls the variation in brightness between the streaks and
the darker region between the streaks. A value of 0 causes the streaks and dark
regions to have the same brightness; a value of 1 causes the streaks to have
the maximum brightness and the dark regions to be black.<p>

By default, all of the image is affected. Enabling <b>Specific Objects</b>
causes the effect to apply to only those pixels whose tag matches the values in the
<b>Object Labels</b> list.<p>
The label image and any user defined frame buffers of type TAG are used by the
selection process.<p>
