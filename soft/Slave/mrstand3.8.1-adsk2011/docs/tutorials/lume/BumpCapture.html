Bump maps are a powerful technique for creating realistically detailed
surfaces; unfortunately an artist has limited tools for creating them.
Typically he must use 2D image editing software, which doesn't provide all the
tools necessary for creating 3D detail.<p>
<FONT FACE=Helvetica>BumpCapture</FONT> comes to the rescue by letting the
artist use the power of a modeler to create his bump map. First the
artist models his surface as an actual geometric object, and then uses <FONT
FACE=Helvetica>BumpCapture</FONT> to transform the geometry into a bump map.
Once in this form, the bump map can be manipulated in more traditional ways:
distorting the bump map, scaling and mixing several bump maps, creating a tiled
bump map, etc.<p>
The image below-right shows the effectiveness of a good bump map. What appears
to be a collection of spheres is actually a flat grid. The left image gives the
grid its color, the middle image is its bump map - created with <FONT
FACE=Helvetica>BumpCapture</FONT>, of course.<p>
