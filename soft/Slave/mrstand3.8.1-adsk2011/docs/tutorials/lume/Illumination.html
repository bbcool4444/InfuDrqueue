The <FONT FACE=Helvetica>Illumination</FONT> shader performs a simple but
important task: providing a physically accurate lighting model for light
sources. This can mean gentle and gradual falloff curves for dim lighting, or
bright and overexposed central areas in bright lighting.<p>
Many times CG artists avoid realistic lighting because of its tendency to
create areas of overexposure, which often look unnatural due to their hard
edges. The <FONT FACE=Helvetica>Glare</FONT> shader corrects this problem,
creating overexposures that look realistic; by using <FONT
FACE=Helvetica>Illumination</FONT><i> </i>in combination with <FONT
FACE=Helvetica>Glare</FONT>, natural lighting effects can be easily achieved.

<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B></B></FONT><b>Brightness Multiplier</b> allows the
artist to turn-up the light's brightness well past 1, likely causing
overexposure in some parts of the image. <p>
<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B>Falloff</B></FONT><p>
With Falloff the artist can set how he wants the light to behave as it falls
off from the source. <b>None</b> and <b>Linear</b>: None tells the light to illuminate all objects with
the same brightness regardless of distance, while Linear provides a
linear fall off.<p>
<b>Realistic</b> uses the r-squared law for fall off. Unlike the Linear
falloff, Realistic fall off causes nearby objects to be extremely bright, while
at the same time distant objects never quite become completely black.<p>
<b>Custom</b> let's the artist specify a custom curve for the light falloff.
<b>Start</b> specifies the distance at which the light begins to diminish,
<b>Mid</b> specifies the distance at which the light is at half intensity, and
<b>End</b> specifies the distance at which the light becomes completely black.
(See the discussion on Custom Curves at the end of this chapter.)<p>
