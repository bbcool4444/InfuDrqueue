<FONT FACE=Helvetica>Landscape</FONT> is a highly versatile shader that helps
to map textures to terrain and other types of complex models in useful and
natural ways, through attributes such as slope, height, image, and noise
functions. For example, on a single piece of terrain geometry it could be used
to create dusty pile-ups on plateau surfaces, exposed rock faces in steeper
cliff-like areas, and water stains where the ground meets the sea. Especially
useful in situations where the size or shape of an object makes handmade
textures impractical.<p>
<FONT FACE=Helvetica>Landscape</FONT> works by blending a base color with an
overlay color. The blending parameter is computed from one or more effects.<p>
<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B><BR><font size=+1>Effects</font></B></FONT><p>
<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B></B></FONT>The artist controls <FONT
FACE=Helvetica>Landscape</FONT> by applying one or more different "effects".
One such effect, <b>Slope</b>, piles a texture on flat surfaces, like snow
piling on a plateau. <b>Height</b> behaves like a waterline. Two different
noise generators, <b>Shape Based</b> and <b>Positional</b>, provide
natural-looking irregularities. <b>Stain</b> allows the artist to confine a
texture with the boundaries of another object. <b>Image</b> allows the
Overlay Color's color or alpha-channel to influence its blending.<p>

<p>
<FONT FACE=Helvetica>Landscape</FONT>'s real strength comes from allowing the
artist to mix these effects. An example is mixing Slope and Height to give snow
on high peaks. We'll explore mixing in detail later.<p>
<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B><BR><font size=+1>Parameters</font></B></FONT><p>
<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B>Overall</B></FONT><b></b><p>
<b>Base Color</b> and <b>Overlay Color</b> are mixed together by a blending parameter
computed from one or more effects.<p>

<b>Blur</b> controls the sharpness of the border between the opaque and
transparent extremes of the alpha-channel. A value of 0 gives a sharp line, a
value of 1 gives a very blurred line.<p>

Most of the effects apply only on a vertical axis and are dependent on the height
above the origin. Use <b>Base Plane Normal</b> and <b>Base Plane Distance</b> to
specify the vertical axis direction and distance relative to the world coordinate system origin.<p>

<b>Relative to Object</b> and <b>Relative to World</b> controls whether the positions 
and angles are measured relative to the world coordinate system or the object coordinate 
system. Relative to World is good in situations where
several different objects need a texture to line up across all the objects.
Relative to Object is useful when an object needs to move, and the texture must move
with it. Also, by rotating the center in Relative to Object mode, effects can be
applied at an angle other than the horizontal.<p>

<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B>Slope Effect</B></FONT><p>
The Slope Effect acts like snow piling on a plateau. Flatter areas receive an
opaque alpha-channel while steep areas receive a transparent alpha-channel.<p>
<b>Active</b> activates the slope effect.<p>

<b>Influence</b> is used for <A HREF="#Mixing">mixing</A>.<p>

<b>Upside Down</b> reverses the direction of the effect, so that the
alpha-channel is opaque in steep areas and and transparent in flat areas.<p>

<b>Angle</b> specifies where the cutoff line is, (i.e. how steep the slope is
before the snow begins falling off) measured in degrees from the XZ plane. <p>

<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B>Height Effect</B></FONT><p>
The Height Effect creates a horizontal line across the object; areas above the
line receive an opaque alpha-channel, areas below receive a transparent
alpha-channel.<p>

<b>Active</b> activates the height effect.<p>

<b>Influence</b> is used for <A HREF="#Mixing">mixing</A>.<p>

<b>Upside Down</b> reverses the direction, so that the alpha-channel is opaque
below the height-line and transparent above it.<p>

<b>Height</b> specifies the height of the dividing line; the line is measured 
either from the object's center or from the world center, according to the Relative to ...
settings. <p>

<b>Spread</b> tells how wide the area of effect should be, for blurring and
mixing with other effects. <p>

<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B>Positional Noise</b> and <b>Shape Based Noise</B></FONT><p>
The two noise generators provide a way to insert randomness into the landscape.
<b>Positional Noise</b> is the noise generator most people are familiar
with; it is based upon the surface's absolute position in space. Unfortunately,
the noise isn't affected by the shape of the surface, and so can sometimes
produce an unnatural pattern. <p>
<b>Shape Based Noise</b> helps alleviate this problem by using the shape
exclusively as the seed for the noise. This means that as the surface dips and
curves, Shape Based Noise will give variations that reflect the change. The
drawback comes when two objects have the same shape, they will have the same
noise; or when a surface is flat, it will receive no noise.<p>

A good effect can often be achieved by mixing Positional and Shape Based
noises.<p>
<b>Active</b> activates the noise effects.<p>

<b>Influence</b> is used for <A HREF="#Mixing">mixing</A>.<p>

<b>Scale</b> controls the size of the largest clumps of noise. For Positional
Noise, Scale is measured in dimensional units. For Shape Based Noise, Scale
is measured in degrees.<p>

<p>
<b>Roughness</b> controls how jagged the edge of the noise is. A value of 0
gives a smooth edge, while a value of 1 gives a rough, speckled edge.<p>

<p>
<b>Coverage</b> controls what percentage of the overall alpha-channel is
opaque. A value of 0 gives 50% opaque areas, 50% transparent areas. Smaller
values give less opaque ares, larger values give more opaque areas.<p>

<p>
<b>Vertical Scale</b> lets the artist stretch the noise in the vertical direction. A value
less than 1 compresses the noise in the vertical direction, giving an appearance
similar to sedimentary rock; a value greater than 1 stretches the noise in the
Vertical direction, giving a appearance similar to dripping stains.<p>

<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B>Stain Effect</B></FONT><p>
The Stain Effect works in conjunction with the <FONT
FACE=Helvetica>Stain</FONT> shader. Any area of the texture contained by a
staining object will receive an opaque alpha-channel, while areas outside the
staining object will receive a transparent alpha-channel.<p>
<b>Active</b> activates the stain effect.<p>

<b>Influence</b> is used for <A HREF="#Mixing">mixing</A>.<p>

<b>Thickness</b> is used to control how far a point must lie within the
staining object before the alpha-channel becomes opaque.<p>
WARNING: This thickness is determined by the viewing angle. Large values for
the thickness can cause the texturing to change as the object or camera change
their relative position in the scene; this can be particularly undesirable in
animation sequences. <p>
<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B>Image Effect</B></FONT><p>
The Image Effect uses the texture itself to affect the alpha channel. Any
combination of the red, green, blue, or alpha channels can be used. Values in
the image above 0.5 will give an opaque alpha-channel, while values below 0.5
give a transparent alpha-channel.<p>
<b>Active</b> activates the image effect.<p>

<b>Influence</b> is used for <A HREF="#Mixing">mixing</A>.<p>

<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B><A NAME="Mixing">Mixing Effects</A></B></FONT><p>
A wide variety of patterns can be achieved by mixing these effects together.
Mixing is accomplished by adjusting the Influence in each of the active
effects. An effect with a high Influence value will tend to dominate the other
effects; an effect with a low Influence value will only subtly modify the other
effects. When specifying Influences, the ratio of the influences is all that is
important.<p>
For example, by mixing Height with a small amount of Positional Noise, we
get a roughened Height line. But if we begin turning up the Influence of the
noise, the line breaks up. At high enough values, we can't distinguish the
line; all we can tell is that the noise is thicker at the top.<p>

<p>
Another example is the mixture of Height and Slope. With a high Influence for
the Height, we get a nearly horizontal line with small dips for flat areas. As
the Influence of the Slope increases height becomes less important, and the
texture tends to cling to flat areas.<p>
