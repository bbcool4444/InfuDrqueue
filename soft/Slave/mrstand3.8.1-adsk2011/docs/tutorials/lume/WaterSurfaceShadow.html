WaterSurfaceShadow is the shadow shader of WaterSurface.
It uses the same parameters.
When looking at water from above, the surface's transparency and reflectivity
changes according to the viewing angle. When looking up from below, this effect
is amplified: some areas are completely reflective, while others are completely
transparent, with little transition between them.<p>
The <FONT FACE=Helvetica>WaterSurfaceShadow</FONT> shader 
generates a varying shadow strength, that allows to generate the
impression of caustics, without the technical overhead of real caustic
photons. The shadow effect is less precise, but much faster to compute.<p>

<b>Surface Material</b> is an input color computed by an illumination shader and
modified by the <FONT FACE=Helvetica>WaterSurface</FONT> shader.
For the shadow case this can be a constant color too<p>
<b>Transparency</b> is the multiplier used to mix the input Surface Material color and the
<FONT FACE=Helvetica>WaterSurface</FONT> effect.<p>
<b>Index of Refraction</b> is a physical property of transparent solids. It
controls how far light is bent when entering the object, how transparent the
object is, how the reflectivity shifts with viewing angle, etc. The Index of
Refraction of water is 1.33; glass is 1.5; diamond is 2.4; alcohol is
1.36.
It has an influence on the intensity of the shadow.<p>

is not used by the shadow shader.<p>
