The <FONT FACE=Helvetica>Ocean</FONT> shader simulates realistic waves over a
large body of water. The artist can control the look and feel of the ocean by
adjusting the waves' height, roughness, speed, direction, etc. <FONT
FACE=Helvetica>Ocean</FONT> can even create a looping animation, with the
number of frames in the loop specified by the user. <p>
<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B><BR><font size=+1>Parameters</font></B></FONT><p>
<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B>Wave Size</B></FONT><p>
These controls affect the waves' basic size and shape. <b>Largest</b> sets
the size of the largest waves in the ocean, <b>Smallest</b> sets the size of
the smallest waves in the ocean, while <b>Quantity</b> sets how many wave
sizes are between Largest and Smallest. Increasing the number of sizes will give a
rougher look to the ocean.<p>
<b>Steepness</b> gives another control on the roughness of the ocean: smaller
values of Steepness will give a calm, flatter ocean, while larger values give a
rougher, more active ocean.<p>

<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B>Wave Position</B></FONT><p>
Wave positions can be <b>Relative to World</b> center, so that two adjoining
grids wave patterns will be aligned; or <b>Relative to Object</b> center, so that as the
object moves, the wave patterns will move with it.<p>
The effect applies only on a vertical axis. Use <b>Base Plane Normal</b> and <b>Base Plane Distance</b> to
specify the vertical axis direction and distance relative to the coordinate system origin.<p>
<b>Directed</b> activates a rolling waves ocean effect. <b>Direction Angle</b> controls 
the overall movement of the waves. When Directed is unselected, the <FONT FACE=Helvetica>Ocean</FONT> 
effect produces a directionless choppy ocean.<p>

<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B>Wave Animation</B></FONT><p>
For animation, two controls are available. <b>Wave Speed</b> controls the
movement rate of the waves. The default value of 1 is a good choice for a scene
where one unit is equivalent to one foot, and where the animation is
at 30 fps.<p>
<b>Loop Animation</b> will force the ocean into a looping animation.
<b>Loop Frames</b> controls the number of frames in the loop. Be warned, smaller
numbers create a less realistic ocean.<p>

<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B>Shape Method</B></FONT><p>
<FONT FACE=Helvetica>Ocean</FONT> creates its effect in one of two ways. As a
<b>Bump</b>, <FONT FACE=Helvetica>Ocean</FONT> creates the illusion of a rough
surface without actually changing the geometry, similar to a bump map. Note
that <FONT FACE=Helvetica>Ocean</FONT>'s bumping effect is independent of the
texture settings, so the Roughness parameter in the texture dialogue box should
be set to 0.<p>
<FONT FACE=Helvetica>Ocean</FONT> is usually best kept in Bump mode, since it
gives a very nice wave effect without requiring additional geometry, and
therefore does not inordinately slow down rendering times. <p>
In <b>Displacement</b> mode, <FONT FACE=Helvetica>Ocean</FONT> creates a
greyscale image for the shape of the ocean, with which it displaces the actual
geometry of the water grid, using the displacement feature of mental ray.<p>
As with all displacement mapping, the object in question must have enough
geometry in order to properly resolve the shape of the displacement map; this
usually results in extremely slowed rendering times. If you wish to use
displacement, a good compromise can be achieved by using <FONT
FACE=Helvetica>Ocean</FONT> twice: once as a Bump for smaller waves, and once
as a Displacement for larger waves.<p>

<FONT FACE=Helvetica><B>Flats</B></FONT><p>
Real oceans or lakes have differing areas of roughness: some regions can be
fairly smooth, while other areas are rough, the variations caused by the
effects of gusting winds. The Flats effect simulates these differing areas. <b>Flats</b>
activates the effect.<p>
<b>Size</b> controls the size of the area, while <b>Variation</b> controls how
different the areas can be: lower values cause less variation, higher values
cause greater variation.<p>
